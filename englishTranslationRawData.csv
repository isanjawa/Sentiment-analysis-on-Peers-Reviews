0,0,"-The article addresses a very relevant and contingent problem, and includes both a national diagnosis of the use of good practices and a solution (good concrete practices). -Language is right.  -The article feels like the concatenation of three different articles: (1) results of a survey, (2) good security practices, (3) incorporation of good practices. -The order of the sections would be better if it reflects this order (the revised version is #2, #1, #3). -The article has no validation of any kind, not even by expert evaluation."
1,0,"The article presents practical recommendations for the development of secure software. Best practices recommended for developing software that is proactive in the face of attacks are described, and a cost analysis of these software development practices is performed. All based on a review of practices proposed in the bibliography and its contrast with data obtained from a survey in companies. Finally a guide is recommended.  It would be ideal to apply the proposed guide to companies that were not involved in the survey, which was used to give them a way to evaluate their effectiveness independently."
2,0,"-The theme is very interesting and can be of much help a guide to incorporate safety practices. -The presentation (description, stage and use) of the 9 practices for the development of secure software.  -The ""real state of software development in Chile"" (as indicated in its paper) cannot be achieved with only 22 surveys out of a total of 50. -It presents nine tables corresponding to the practices for the development of secure software, but the guide presents 10 practices. Why? -I suggest improving the guide, the greatest contribution is in the sequence of incorporation that you propose.  Furthermore, you should not explain the practice in Observations or differentiate it with other practices in that column, but you should give suggestions on how to apply it. -In the text indicates ""Later, there are also three extra practices ..."" What are or did I not read correctly? -According to format, put at least 5 keywords. -I suggest mentioning the practices before showing each table. -Some references are incomplete, for example, missing year in reference 17, missing year and type of event in reference 11, editorial lack in reference 19 (is it a book?)-Some titles carry a comma within the quotation marks, example, reference 1"
3,1,"An ICT use experience for academic collaboration is explained in an orderly and didactic way.  The originality of the work is not its strong dimension, seeing long-standing works like Gorton et al. (1997) and current as Lanunile et al. (2010). However, the relevance of the topic as a reference pattern in activities related to scientific theses, associated with its good presentation, make it a contribution.  It is suggested, in view of a journal publication, that the efficiency and effectiveness of the activities be compared without the support of these tools versus the current reality (with tools). Examples of possible questions to answer from this exploratory analysis: What are the main activities where the use of collaborative tools is key? What changes in the design of these tools should be developed in the future? Are there more conducive student/academic profiles for the adoption of these platforms?

4,1,"The authors describe a methodology for developing, in collaborative form, theses and memories using technologies that are commonly used in software development. They also describe specific tools and their benefits, such as Latex and Git. Finally, they propose a workflow for the development of projects of this nature.  The main value of the article lies in the application of knowledge that students already dominate-that is, software development techniques and tools-to a different problem as is the case with theses and memories. All this, in order to make the process more efficient.  1.-The emphasis of the article is the solution without a detailed analysis of the problem to be solved. In other words, there are no answers to the following questions: a.-what exactly is the problem? b.-what impacts do this problem generate? c.-why is it important to solve the problem? d.-what solutions have been implemented to date? e.-what are the advantages of the proposed solution compared to previous ones?   2.-In my opinion, the article should emphasize more the methodology and the workflow. For example, add a diagram-using a visual language-that allows, on the one hand, to understand the general process of thesis development and, on the other, to distinguish the roles, activities and associated technologies in each phase of the memory.  3.-Some aspects of the language and the rigor of certain statements, such as: ""(given the rather atrocious spelling of the engineers), must be taken care of."" Do the authors have any empirical support to support this statement? Is it necessary to use such a prosaic language to justify the desirability of using a particular technological tool? By the way, I recommend reviewing the expressions: ""it is not public"" (point 3.1) and ""The access directly ..."" (point 3.2)"
5,2,"This paper proposes a new approach based on [25] to support the recommendation of the RS through the evolution of the weights of user characteristics through two approaches to the use of genetic algorithms. The work appears technically correct and the proposal presents robust results as presented in the document.  The document has a series of errors that appear to cause confusion, where variable names, abbreviations or presentation format for variable sub-indices are changed, etc. For example: equation 2, function w, abbreviation CF, figure 3, figure 6. The approach apparently uses only a part of the BD for efficiency reasons, it would be good to use some indexing technique to support this process."
6,2,"This paper aims to show new deployment alternative for rewarding systems. To this end, the authors use two variations CHC genetic algorithm.  -It's a good job. -It is clear and very detailed.  -There are inconsistencies in the notation should be improved. The formula (7) has a notation different from the rest of the equations. -On the same point, the figure (3) refers to ""profile"", ""pesos"", ""euclidean"" and ""neighborhood""; these words aren't related with the text. -I think that the results shown in graphs would be more useful if they are shown in tables."
7,2,"The paper is well structured. It follows a logical sequence of sections.  The paper does not fix to the Infonor conference template.  The english grammar is poor. It makes the paper difficult to read and follow. Either: a) rewrite the paper in spanish, or b) make the paper reviewed by a professional translator Most of the references are not recent (2005-2010). No new work since 2003? Some references do not indicate year.  Problems with equations, fonts, etc.  Figures 5-17 are not referenced/discussed/explained. It may be better to present these figures as a table.  Both, result analysis and conclusions, declare that GA CHC is better than Pearson's correlation Algorithm. However, this analysis and conclusion is not supported for a wide variety of situations and conditions. Therefore, a true validation work is missing."
8,3,A novel quantum encryption modelling work is performed I do not see negative aspects
9,3,"This paper involves the development of an application that simulate the BB84 protocol, an orderly work is appreciated and without a doubt the understanding of some concepts of quantum physics that underpin quantum cryptography as are the non-cloning theorem and the principle of overlap and interlacing is a work that has its merits, in addition, the use of software engineering in the construction of the application is appreciated, which is a very positive aspect, since usually when there is involved software creation in areas of frontier knowledge, the code-and-fix is used, with all the disadvantages that this entails.  I believe that this manuscript should be directed to the area of cryptography and security, in my specialty that is computing in distributed environments I do not see significant relevance and input from the manuscript, using RMI according to my opinion is not a contribution per se, since RMI is easy to use if it is handled JAVA, however, it is not interoperable since it does not support other programming languages, besides, the system based on RMI as they grow have a problem of performance, while the more they grow slower become, on the other hand, according to some purists a client/server system is not a system distributed, according to others the case client/server is the most basic case of distributed computing, in short, speaking strictly from the area of distributed computing I do not see relevance in this area of this manuscript, however, it seems to me that in another area the paper could be relevant, since it is an orderly, clear and well written work.  I am not an expert in the area of cryptography, but a few years ago I heard in a seminar an English speaking of quantum cryptography and mentioned a lot of simulators and applications, even said to have applications that already used quantum cryptography among several kilometers by optical fiber, then I think it is best to evaluate this manuscript in that area and not in the area of grid/distributed systems, since in this area the paper according to my opinion has no original aspects, since it uses trivial aspects of the client/server principles.  As I have already said, paper has more issues of quantum physics and cryptography than distributed computing, so abstracting me to the area that I am responsible for, I see the use of a distributed environment technology used as a client/server, not interoperable and with scalability restrictions. One positive aspect in the paper is that you appreciate the use of software engineering.  Regarding the area of grid computing and distributed systems, the manuscript does not contain relevant aspects, uses RMI to implement a client/server system, however, RMI is easy to use and as a good paradigm known in computing, performance is counterposed with ease of use, RMI does not escape that, because it is easy to use, but it has no scalability.  The document is well presented, perhaps Table 2 and Table 3 would be better to merge using rows as a computer and in the columns the details of the network, especially if more than a client/server scheme is for example, a ring of distribution of quantum keys, with more than 2 computers involved. I believe that presented to the area of cryptography and security would be more pertinent."
10,4,"Novel proposal. Well structured. Correctly written. I only suggest: Explain in more detail the trapezoidal function of page 2. Rewrite the paragraph above to the trapezoidal function A (x). Enlarge the scheme of Figure 1. Explain the proposed architecture shown in Figure 2. Review of Feng et al. which is the reference 2 and in a paragraph in column 2 page 1 is marked as reference 1.  Article is not in the format requested by Infonor, please change to this format."
11,4,"The theme is interesting and is well structured as far as the design of the proposal is concerned.  The topic is about an approach to improvement, however it only establishes a proposal of architecture, focusing on the design, and does not indicate how this improvement will be evaluated or measured for the SDW, it is recommended to add metrics or other aspects for it. It does not provide many details, it is recommended to increase the nro. of pages to improve this aspect. There are not many bibliographic references to work or related efforts on the subject."
12,4,"With a high technical profile, it is a contribution to the theme.  Too concise, it could be extended in the as (above all from the fuzzy input)."
13,5,"-Innovative proposal for the application of an industrial engineering methodology, to the field of requirements engineering.  -It does not present unification of terms throughout the document, related to the requirements engineering phase: 'eduction', 'elicitation' ... The same term should always be used. -It is not evident how the gradual 'improvements' of the construction process are quantified, and the 'improvement' in the quality of the documentation ... how do they measure this improvement?? -There are writing and spelling errors, particularly in the use of the accent (tildes) and punctuation signs (use of the comma and semicolon).  The article proposes the use of a working philosophy of another engineering area, to improve the quality levels of the requirements documents generated in a process of qualification education.  I believe that from the technical point of view it would be important to support the analysis of results that they pose in a quantified measurement or comparison, that allows by means of a more formal method than the descriptive one to generate the conclusions of 'improvement' in the quality of the products associated to the process of engineering of requirements.  Is it not evident how they arrive at the generated conclusions, what they are based on to say what is better or not, what has less errors or not??  It is an interesting proposal that can be applied in real cases of requirements engineering processes. It currently contributes to reducing the crisis associated with this phase of software product development.  The organisation of the document can be significantly improved. I consider that they devote much of the article to expressing the associated conceptual framework, and less to the application of the technique in the case of study and to the analysis of results, paragraphs in which the proposal presented can be supported further. Likewise, there are spelling and writing errors that, if avoided, can give greater value to the presentation of the article."
14,5,"Try to apply a new strategy to requirements management. It does not support or consider the applicability of processes of manufacturing processes to software processes. While it is true that there are authors such as Demming who argue that it is possible to do so, there are other authors such as Sommerville who argue that because of the characteristics of software development, the techniques of manufacturing processes are not applicable to software. The authors of this article do not provide support in relation to the validity of this aspect. The article begins by stating that the proposal is to improve the eduction of requirements, however, it is then derived in that what is improved is the generation of the SRS. The construction and the generation of the document of requirements are different aspects. In the case of experimentation that is presented, it is not seen that problems are solved either in the construction or in the generation of the SRS, they are rather problems of implementation. The errors detected are basic aspects that any programmer with a minimum of experience knows how to solve them, without the need for the SRS to explain the type of minimum validations to be performed as part of the system tests. The proposal lacks practical guidelines to help in its implementation, how should these POKA-YOKE reviews be carried out? In what ways should we look? Are there artifacts to guide the review? There are editing errors in the text (repeated words) There are spelling problems (word accentuation)"
15,5,"Good practice to ensure quality in requirements eduction-Summary is poorly worded, there should be no theoretical explanations-The translation of the summary is lousy-The article is not written in third person-The POKA YOKE Section should go before the section VARIABILITY OF REQUIREMENTS AND COST OF QUALITY. -There are several spelling errors"
16,6,"The article details a proposal for requirements management based on KAIZEN. The authors describe different methods and techniques to complement Kaizen I understand that the main contribution of this work is, according to the authors, to complement and improve Kaizen for the elicitation and management of requirements. However, the authors of the article present only a theoretical construction of their proposal.  I understand that the article lacks work to be done, in order to validate the proposal. However, as an article developed by six researchers, I believe that it should include more practical aspects of the proposal."
17,6,"Interesting work.  Although the document shows a proposal, it would be interesting to show applications."
18,7,"The paper describes an experience concerning the automated inspection of spectra for the Pipeline Hubble Legacy Archive Grism data.  Comments: In the conclusions the authors say that "" We have identified two classes of weak spectra which were not picked up by the automatic classification because of their very small number of training samples. Per construction machine learning techniques can not classify such outliers. "" This sentence should be further explained. As Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman say in The Elements of Statistical Learning (see Chapter 7): ""it is too difficult to give a general rule on how much training data is enough; among other things, this depends on the signal-to-noise ratio of the underlying function, and the complexity of the models being fit to the data."" So, by just saying that the number of training samples is small you do not provide enough information to decide whether machine learning techniques are adequate or not to solve a problem.  Other minor comments: + If reference [2] has not yet been written or published it should be deleted from the paper.  The dataset may be of scientific importance.  It is mainly descriptive."
19,7,"This manuscript addresses an interesting solution based in machine learning techniques to classify spectra legacy data of the Hubble Space Telescope in order to publish the results and ""good"" spectra in Internet to scientific community. The manuscript is well-written and results are robust. Experiment is sound and the manuscript seems acceptable in the current form. The work can be short, but very interesting to the Infonor and JCC community.  The main problem of the paper is that it is difficult to compare results for the classifiers used. A confusion matrix and parameters for each classifier could clarify results."
20,7,"Interesting application domain.  Nothing new from a machine learning perspective. They authors should provide more information about the models they have obtained with the different classifiers (feature subset selection used, selected features, accurate, statistical significance on the differences on accurate, the models themselves, ...). Semi-supervised classification is the appropriate method for the last paragraph in the ""Methodology"" section."
21,8,"This paper presents a tool (SAVE) for software architecture verification. SAVE performs a static check of rules associated with permitted and prohibited dependencies between elements of the design and the code, and allows to deliver a report on the consistency between the two levels with respect to said rules.  Overall the tool seems quite powerful for two reasons: the use of simple rules and the inclusion of pre-defined rule sets for wide-use design patterns. This, in my view, is the most important difference with other similar frameworks.  The wording is, in some places, unobjective. In particular I would suggest avoiding the excessive use of adjectives for which no evidence is provided that supports them. For example, in several places I noticed the use of ""powerful tool"", ""intuitive tool"" or the like (not only referring to SAVE, but other works). In all such cases, there is no explicit provision of evidence to support the use of such adjectives.  Another detail that requires fix is the title that appears in the PDF file: ""Preaching behavior dynamics ..."", which does not match the paper title. The authors probably used a template of a previous paper with that title."
22,8,"The verification of the architecture of a software product can be a great contribution to the quality of the software. Therefore, any tool that facilitates this work is a contribution to the software engineering. They present evidence of a prior review of alternative or complementary methods and tools to the proposal. The descriptions presented are accompanied by clarifying examples.  The role and interaction of the domain expert is unclear. In the initial sections it says that the tool performs static and dynamic analysis, however at the end of the article, in the identification of possible improvements of SAVE it is proposed to include the dynamic analysis, which contradicts with the initial affirmation. The description of the operation of the tool is not clear enough. The quality of the figures is not adequate, for the size and resolution of the figures it is not possible to appreciate the details well. Article wording can be improved. There are several phrases where connectors are missing, for example ""In this section, we will see S.A.V.E. manages to recover the existing dependencies in the source code ...."" Many errors in the accentuation of words."
23,9,"New proposal, highly valuable the linking of people from the business scope that allows the theory and proposals for software engineering to be tested in real environments. Well structured and very well drafted.  I only suggest scheming the activities of the White Belt IR-SixSigma training app and reviewing small drafting details."
24,9,Good practice for better quality in requirements engineering-In the abstract there should be no theory-There should be a case study to better see the application of the methodology
25,10,Interesting proposal in a software development environment that is quite poor in methodological aspects of development.  There is a lack of related work or perhaps better discussion in the introduction with references to substantiate the interesting proposal. Review wording. It is not in order by Infonor. It is suggested not to add links of web pages in the text of the article.
26,10,"The authors have designed a methodology to develop software to support scientific research projects. They accurately identify the differences between the development of research software and software for commercial purposes. They also propose a methodology following a approach of agile methods of software development.  The proposal is in a design phase, has been elaborated from interviews with potential users and is likely to be tested in future research.  In my opinion, the article requires a paragraph that takes into account the methodology that the authors have followed in order to reach the proposal. Reference is made to interviews with: ""participants in this type of project"", however, it is not reported how many people were consulted, how the interviewees were selected, what instruments were applied and how the data were analyzed."
27,10,"I consider, first of all, that the area of development of the subject (development of software in research environments ...) does not ""grant permission"" to carry out this development more informally (times, relax in versions, scarce documentation, etc.). 2nd, I do not see why it is only SCRUM, without making basic comparisons with the other ""classic"" exponents of agile methodologies (XP and FDD), which gives a certain ""light"" to the initial analysis of the authors (without doubt one could delve a little more, especially with XP)."
28,11,"It is an article that presents a novel theme in the area of Software Engineering. The article is well documented and well-founded. The technologies used in the development of the prototype are of current interest.  As described in the article, this is a first step in a line of research and development of a prototype of a meta-case application. There remains this sense, unclear what the current level of maturity is, both of the research and the application developed."
29,11,"This paper presents a software tool that is useful in the context of software engineering. The authors do a good job describing the technical details of the tool. However, there is little information about the novel aspects of the proposed tool, How the proposal compares to other existing tools (if any)?"

31,12,"The article presents the design of a prototype that implements a system for the acquisition of data by wireless mobile devices, applied to mining, specifically in the monitoring of particulate matter. The application of the mobile technology to a particular problem of the Chilean mining industry is interesting, as well as the article describes the problematic and the proposed prototype very clearly.  The article is novel because the use of computing (data processing) and mobile device technologies applied to a particular problem of the Chilean mining industry.  The problem, the technology presented (BUG) and the proposed prototype are clearly described.  The application of current mobile computing technologies in important industrial sectors of the country is relevant.  The main title and the summary must be written in Spanish and English (only come in Spanish). In addition, the article presents a list of 29 references, but only references one (the first in the list). It even appears in the PCFactory References, and it is not very clear why."
32,12,It considers the use of mobile technologies to incorporate in the measurement of particulate matter that exists inside a mine. It will be interesting to see the advantages and disadvantages of this application with existing ones.  It's a study only. There are no results yet.
33,13,"We appreciate an extensive work that is valued, however several inconsistencies are observed throughout the work.  It is observed on page 4 Figure 1 the indication of a conceptual model being this of the snowflake type, however the correct thing would be to indicate that it is a scheme of logical design and not of conceptual design of DW. In addition, a correct conceptual scheme should not indicate the type of data. Also in this aspect is a reference to a star schema bibliography. There was no research on conceptual models for DW to avoid the above.  A lot of redundancy in technical problems that should not be of importance to the article.  There is talk of business intelligence but in a strict sense if you apply business intelligence you need an ""expert"" analyst who is able to make decisions with the trends found in the study, which is not presented in the article.  Related job references are missing, as only books are referenced. A review to related works would have been very useful in the sense of structuring the article better.  There are methodologies to schematize the ETL process that would have improved this aspect described in the article."
34,13,The article presents the process of constructing a data warehouse to implement OLAP on data for the exploitation of marine resources on the coasts of Chile.  The problem is clearly defined and has relevant practical application for the country.  The work presented corresponds to a case of very complete and well documented use of well known data mining techniques.  The ABSTRACT must be edited to represent an appropriate and readable translation of the SUMMARY.  The original contribution of the work is not evident.  The original conclusions of the article are related to the domain of the application (statistics of the exploitation of marine resources) and not to topics relevant to the conference.  Missing information in the literature should be completed.
35,13,"The article presents the development of a solution to the problem of analyzing trends in the landing of marine species on the Chilean coastal edge, using business intelligence tools.  (a) aspects of form 1. The English version of the title and the summary of the article contains grammatical, editorial, and style errors.  2. Use of capital letters: Chile -- > Chile national fishing service -- > National Kettle Fishing Service -- > Kettle table 1 -- > Table 1 api -- > API etc.  3. Figure 2 is not referenced This figure shows -- > Figure 10 shows 4. paragraph after Figure 1 is written in 1 column. must be in 2 columns 5. format does not fully match the Infonor format.  (b) substantive aspects 1. The article does not report research results. This is an application of BI techniques to provide data-line analysis support.  2. It is weak in terms of background of processes and techniques used. Although 12 references are listed, only 2 or 3 of them are quoted repeatedly. There is no review of related jobs (BI application cases.) 3. Given the orientation of the article, the (potential) use of the results should be further detailed. In this sense, there must be greater and better interpretation/evaluation by the users of the analysis of the information."
36,14,"The present paper performs a categorization of ways to integrate business rules into a design using the aspect-oriented paradigm and proposes a template of documentation for business rules based on such categorization.  The paper delivers useful information about the particular problem, as well as a reasonable categorization of different aspects in this problem. It's a good starting point for an investigation on that line.  Although the information given in the paper is of the utmost importance for an investigation in this matter, it is insufficient to accept it as a complete and self-contained work. The reason is that the paper focuses on identifying problems and proposing an artifact (the template) that should solve these problems. However, it does not present evidence of why this template is a good alternative for solving these problems. This requires the elements mentioned in future work, specifically the formal specification and the automatic tool to create templates and map them to AOP.  My suggestion is to wait for these items to be ready to complete this paper and send it to a new conference."
37,14,"The work presents a viable alternative to solving the problem of changing business rules.  It can be improved by adding some more background to the topic of aspects, since a prior knowledge of this topic is assumed, so the paper is not self-contained."
38,14,"The work presents a methodology to address the complexity of implementing business rules without making changes to the base functionality of a system.  It proposes a clear methodology based on documentation using templates to manage and analyze the impact of performing the implementation of a business rule via orientation to the aspect.  The reasons presented to indicate that the OA approach to encapsulate the connection between business rules and base functionality is not a trivial task, they are general and should be addressed in greater depth.  It does not provide formal evidence that the use of the proposed templates specifically resolves a problem.  It is suggested to present a problem solved by means of the tool that is in development that automatically handles the templates. Failing that, demonstrate the application to a specific problem."
39,15,"It is an article that presents an interesting diagnosis of the software development companies of Chile. They incorporate an initial statistical base that gives formality to the work done, specifically for the determination of the base sample for the development of the surveys. However, the statistical data of the results are not part of the work presented.  Presentation of statistical results that validate the conclusions presented and the findings found, about the diagnosis.  The authors are recommended to continue in the work in order to incorporate the statistical bases in the companies of the sector in other countries.  Other recommendations: A thorough review of English and in particular for the presentation of an article, the translation of this language should be carefully reviewed. Particularly review the title, where there is an error in the first word."
40,16,"The development of a prototype for an automatic software requirement allocation tool among developers is presented. This tool can be very useful for software development teams. It is a question of making a contribution through this tool to the quality of the developed products.  It is not explained what heuristic is used for the assignment of requirements to programmers. No study of the existing requirements management tools is presented, where it is demonstrated that there are no alternative tools to the one presented. And if there are alternatives, justify why develop a new one. The functionality of the tool is not clearly explained. There is no evidence of the improvement of the process by including this tool, it is only said in the conclusions that ""the change in the quality of the process is perceptible"". The bibliographic references used are mostly web pages, no bibliographic review is noted in specialized databases. The figures are not distinguished well. Bibliographic references do not comply with the established format. You must write in third person."
41,16,"-A novel requirements planning proposal for a software factory, as a contribution towards improving the quality of projects.  -Although the title of the article is oriented towards the 'planning of requirements', this point is only addressed again when they narrate how they implemented the prototype. -They do not include a conceptual basis to support the role played by the requirements administration in the software development process and particularly in the quality assurance of the process. -It is not evidenced as with a contribution in the automatic planning of the requirements for the software factory, this will allow it to reduce its development times (estimated vs real) and therefore to ensure a higher quality. -The relationship that exists between the proposal that it makes in the framework of CMMI is not very clear.  The article proposes a model of requirements planning, supported by an automatic tool.  The prototype they propose is interesting and relevant. I think it can better organize the model and method that they propose associated with it, which in reality is the real contribution of the authors. I believe that from the technical point of view it would be important that the analysis of results that they raise with the case of the study of the bank, be done by means of a quantitative interpretation or comparison, that it really shows that with this automatic planning is really improving the quality of the process and/or at least the estimate and actual execution of times of development will be less, scenario that according to antecedents has already been justified in its direct relation with the quality.  It is an interesting proposal that can be applied in real cases of requirements engineering management processes. Currently, it will contribute to the reduction of the times associated with this phase of development of software products, and consequently to the quality of the process. Considering that the Engineering of Requirements has so many problematic causes and actions, that generate software crisis and therefore an affectation in quality management, it remains as an open question that really a contribution towards the 'planning' of the requirement has a considerable effect, with respect to other causes or crucial points such as the 'prioritization of requirements', the validation and/or its traceability as such.  The organization of the document can improve in the following aspects:-Some of the figures that are included are not necessary, because they do not really contribute anything additional of what is described in the text, besides that they visually do not say much. -In the section of 'Design of APARD' they name many aspects of technical order characteristic of the factories of reference software, that do not give greater weight to the intention of the article, nor are giving really influential data for the application. -You can optimize the quality of the figures (mainly those that show the internal components of the algorithm and the actions of use of the system-profiles, because they are the ones that show the greatest contribution). -There are several drafting errors that should be reviewed (p. example: use of 'on the basis of', should be changed to 'based on'; 'is used', by 'is used' ..)"
42,16,"-The APARD tool-The theme associated with requirements and software factory is interesting-Is not detailed the practical case that considers the APARD use with its advantages and limitations-The section that explains the implementation of the APARD solution should be improved-Improve conclusions-The presentation: with spelling and writing errors, written in first person, figures with very small letters, white letters in figures make it unreadable, written references in different form, etc. -It is recommended not to use Wikipedia as a reference for a scientific article. -Missing author in references 6, missing topic name in reference 13-Reference 7 is written with author differently than others and with title before author. -Change ""Keywords"" to ""Keywords"". -According to format, put at least 5 keywords. -It puts reference in another format, example, Greenfield and Short (2003)-There is a lot of detail of technologies and tools and products detailed in the Technology Specification section of APARD-What does IQNET [z] mean? -I suggest putting in Introduction the sections that make up the paper."
43,17,"The topic of the article is novel and necessary in the literature of process modeling. Work in general presents a poor development in the theoretical. In order to bring about the comparison between process modeling techniques, a methodology must be constructed that effectively shows the advantages of one method over the other.  The comparison made between the methods should be presented for a general case, since nowhere does the methodology explain what is going to be applied to a particular situation.  The methodology of the article does not adequately explain the way in which the comparison was developed, it only exposes the decision criteria used in its construction, which does not allow to properly evaluate the results obtained.  The research question and the objectives of the study are not clearly set out."

These concepts are built into the CASE tools, even though the document does not present in depth. Perhaps a greater contribution would have been to investigate the formal methods and to extend the comparative analysis of methods."

46,18,"This paper proposes a new approach to support the prioritization of requirements through a process of transformation of Use Cases in a dependency graph through the application of IR techniques, Bayesian networks and domain expert assessment. The approach is presented as an interesting input for the prioritization of requirements and shows its application to a real case. The document is well written and very well supported by references. The results are robust according to the approach used and well-routed future work is presented.  Some typographical or editorial errors can be found on page 5 (paragraph 1 and 2). Confusion over the use of k and K on page 5 (or typo). It may not be clear to use the knowledge of the prioritization made in the test base case with respect to the one performed semi-automatically by its approach, except that the expert's knowledge is used. Perhaps an objective comparison between the two prioritizations would be adequate."
47,18,"From the point of view of Bayesian networks, the work does nothing more than a direct application of the implementation in Genie of the algorithm K2 (Cooper and Hervokits, 1992). It is not clear to use the potentiality of this probabilistic graphic model at the level of inference or classification. The references included in the list must be refined (it does not make sense to include references from the '90s in which the' sent ' label appears)."
48,19,"The issue is topical and the third mission is being recreated through the proposal. I find it meritorious and interesting, in addition to the multiplier effect that this entails for businesses and universities in addressing real problems, with real 'people'.  Defined Acronyms do not present or represent their origin or source. For example, FCAB, says the company of Railways, but does not conform to the reality, because it should be the Railways of Antofagasta. And so with others, such as CMM, HPC, AMPL, that lack meaning.  The theme of the proposal is not clearly discussed in its context, nor the contributions and/or innovations in contrast to other proposals of the same nature that could be cited in references, bibliography, papers or articles, where they may well give or deliver some considerations on the state of the art of the problem. This could be done either in the introduction or in the presentation of the problem.  Lack of clarity in the form of expression or in the definition. I mean, for example, ""normal diagram"", ""normal diagram problem"" and ""NxN diagram problem"". (in the latter at least one example is mentioned.), ""balanced diagram model"", among others.  Many value judgments are made without having the backing for it. I mean that there is textual mention ... ""this algorithm is of slow convergence ..."" ""... the commercial systems and many free systems in the Web......use heuristic techniques, in order to make it efficient."" ""Slow"", in what sense?, since there is a lattice of possibilities that could justify such a judgment, which it refers to? ""commercial systems"", to which one does it refer? ""free systems"" refers to FOSS systems (Free and open source software)? ""heuristic techniques"", which of the aforementioned use this technique?. ""make it more efficient,"" just like before, in what sense, make it more efficient.?. If so, it is not right now?  It is not necessary to substantiate and support such judgments with works and/or bibliographic references, for example.  There is talk of a graph, which would be representing the problem. There are so many modeling tools, which pity that a particular graphic model is not present or displayed.  The format of the input files, and/or transformations to be suffered by these files to feed the AMPL files in the process of Reading/Transforming data to AMPL, is unknown. Similarly, for when you retrieve it in AMPL format and translate it into XML format. The use of the Domain-Specific Language (DSL) would be a plausible solution?  Why SSH?, what study does such a decision endorse??? How is authentication performed? what method does it use? Authentication via password, card, voice, etc. ..  Reference is made to a number of classic books, which do not correlate with the presentation, nor with the context of the proposal. Very generic. I could be more specific about why I quote these books. In addition, the link (numbering) to the references is not mentioned in the proposal.  It lacks conclusions, or acknowledgments. I imagine that FCAB facilitated the infrastructure and the problematic.  It lacks links to the portals of the tools they used or used. For example. http://www.ampl.com http://www.ampl.com, http://www.openssh.com/, among others."

The proposal manages to present a dynamic, in this case, of the agricultural society, which will leverage knowledge management. An interesting derivative of the proposal is that it has served to identify the opportunities that exist in the Region and its surroundings, in the light of the actions that are being exercised in order to obtain even more of them, specifically I mean the University, governmental entities and society.  Lack of international references to the standards (if any?) that they wish to achieve in this field.

The article is called a platform for knowledge management, however the article does not define the theoretical framework appropriate to this theme. (there are no relevant authors in the management of knowledge and processes associated with it).  The article does not adequately justify in the literature the relevance of these platforms in the process of learning and international experiences in the topic. There is no section that presents the research methodology selected by the authors, rather the authors describe an application and its components. The design of the investigation is clearly lacking.

Which makes it difficult to follow up. Bibliographic references could be more current and higher level."
62,24,"The publication deals with a system for the reconstruction of surfaces through a scan, using a conventional video camera, a motor and a laser. Under this scheme, a low-cost system is developed, with the advantages and limitations of the proposal.  -I think the proposed system starts from an interesting premise that is its low cost. Commercial systems for this type of development can be, on most occasions, very high costs, depending on the type of elements that are used. -Despite the simplicity of the proposed architecture, I think the system is upgradeable. For now, I think there is a lack of a way to go (as read in the paper) as regards its use beyond the laboratory.  That's why in ORIGINALITY (ORIGINALITY) is rated with note 4 (good)-One of the first weaknesses found in the publication is its introduction. It seems to me two problems: The first problem is that its content is too general, in all its extension there is talk of computer vision, in general, but there are no interesting aspects such as the state of the art in this matter and a relevant bibliography. Only general features are said: ""In works carried out in relation to this subject, it is usually the object that moves in millimeter form ..."". From this I have doubts as to how: are there other ways of reconstructing surfaces? Are there similar works? How is this technique different from others? What is the contribution of your work? Why not use stereo vision (perhaps the costs are similar)?  The second problem encountered is the result of the first problem, as in trying to explain what is computer vision is too long (a little more than three columns), and too general. Perhaps if you had focused attention on the state of art this would not see you as a problem.  -In the technical aspect I see that your approach can work in a very controlled environment, where there are no great changes of illumination and the surface of the scanned objects are of colors that are not very similar to the background and/or laser beam used. The subtraction for controlled environments can work, but on the outside I doubt that your system is so stable. I believe that the various methods used for segmentation could have been listed in the text. In page 4, reference is made but not delved (""For segmentation, different methods were tested, from which the method of subtraction of images was selected ...""). Perhaps it would be nice to take advantage of some color space (RBG, YUV, etc.) and use the distance of Mahalanobis (get a sample of a laser beam or several) to obtain better segmentation of the laser light.  -On the presentation, I have found some errors that would be good to improve:-Figure 2 and figure 3 have the same title, I think there is an error with the title of figure 3.  -Figure 2 has some errors and can be misleading. ""Light projector"", the ""de"" is underlined. And ""b"" may confuse as it appears with a underscore.  -Some details:-Page 5: ""The above generates you ...""-Page 6: ""which you get better ...""-The word laser appears untilde on some occasions. Review the title that accompanies each page.   -among others."

64,25,"The novelty of the subject to be dealt with makes the article an interesting research. It has a very good presentation and is easy to read, which gives a striking aspect to the subject. Despite being a subject that includes two very different disciplines, they have managed to properly synchronize the concepts in such a way that research is important and brings knowledge from the initial part of the work done, to the conclusions themselves. It is recommended that the authors continue with the work in order to finish other aspects related to public health.    Recommendations: It is essential to improve the quality of the figures, there are some that it is impossible to visualize, as is the case of Figure 4, Figure 6, Figure 7 and Figure 8."
65,25,"-Good review of trends, technologies and standards that could be used for the implementation of telemedicine systems. -Interesting practical case they make of the SAT system and its possible applications from the Ing. of Software-The initiatives and trends that they show in telemedicine, should describe them according to the sections that deal with the article: integration, interoperability and application development, and not in general as they present. By this disarticulation, it is possible that the consequence is not very clear between what they present in the abstract and what is found in the development of the paper. -I consider that the title should not focus only on 'Tools', as starting to read the work is the idea q the contribution and the review is more at the operational level and systems that support the process, more not of initiatives in terms of standards, projects and technologies developed for this purpose. The title does not have the scope of the content.  The article describes in the Chilean case, what could be initiatives, trends and technologies for the application of software engineering in the field of telemedicine. It does not represent originality as such in either area.  The technical quality is good in that the review they describe is supported bibliographically, with current trends, technologies and standards. As for technical writing, if there are errors in the proper use of the acronyms, in some cases they do not show their meaning, in some other cases they are not well used. (For example: ICT, not TICs; should be said in the citation of references in the text, the score must be deleted before the number -- > specialist [14]; the figures can be significantly improved). The description of the 'trends' and 'initiatives' would give greater value to the article than examples such as the one included in this last section showing the representation of a message in different syntax.  It is relevant to the Chilean context, when they present an interesting proposal for the different actors (government, developers, companies) to consider in order to promote this area of work.  The organization of the document can be improved in the aspects named in ' technical quality, as well as aspects that evidence a consequence and coherence between title, summary and development of the article. Likewise, there are spelling and writing errors that, if avoided, can give greater value to the presentation of the article."
66,26,"A very good job, it presents integration of various technologies in a clear and coherent way Even though they mention it as future work, it should take into account the HL7 from already"
67,27,"This paper presents important problems in its formulation.  Practical experience papers should deliver more than just a description of the developed system: they must clearly indicate what new knowledge, technique or solution was gained from such experience. Consequently, a paper of this nature should include, at least, the following essential elements:-An introduction that clearly explains the purpose of the work: (a) the problem that was solved directly or indirectly with the practical experience, (b) why the problem is important and not trivial and (c) why this experience delivered new information within that context (not obtained with similar experiences). -Theoretical framework-The description of the system: it should not be a mere enumeration of its components and functionalities, but clearly indicate those elements that, during its development, provided relevant information to the study problem. -Conclusions: they must be aligned with the elements of the introduction and must be supported by the evidence provided in the description of the system.  Analyzing the paper under this perspective, we find important problems: First, the introduction is not clear about the purpose of the work and. The only part where the objectives are mentioned is in the 5o parrado, where it is indicated that the case study is ""to empirically demonstrate the development costs"" associated with the technologies shown in the paper. This, along with ""highlighting the main features and potential virtues of CakePHP and MVC .."" appear to be the core elements of the paper.  Second, the system description does not differ much from a system manual; essential evidence is lacking to support the elements of the introduction: associated development costs (time, people, resources) which, it is assumed, should be lower than with another methodology. While the sections describing CakePHP and MVC have information relevant to the problem, they do not value the work if they are not supported by evidence directly obtained from the development experience with this technology. Above all, I missed a comparison with some other similar experience, indicating, clearly what development improvements CakePHP/MVC introduces.  Finally, the paper's conclusions are not aligned with the elements indicated in the introduction; some of them deliver information out of context (conclusions #5 and #6) or are irrelevant (conclusion #2); others lack evidence to support them (conclusion #1) or are not explicit in associating the evidence with what is concluded (conclusions #3 and #4).  Apart from the above comments, the paper also requires improvements in the presentation of information. For example, the value that the SQL code of figures 10 and 11 deliver to the paper is not explicit. Figures 12-15 are not adequately described. A person who does not understand the command line job well can end up totally disoriented and will not understand the arguments put forward.  For all these reasons, the paper is not in a position to be accepted for publication."
68,27,It presents a framework for the work of MVC with PHP in a simple way.  I could be a bit more technical in terms of configuration items and add comparison with other existing frameworks to understand why CakePHP and no other alternative.
69,27,"The work exposes the application of the CakePHP framewok to a specific problem.  It clearly exposes the use of the MVC pattern through CakePHP.  The introduction is very general and puts emphasis on elements (quality, time and RAD) that are not developed or demonstrated in depth at work.  Presents the case study in CakePHP, without making a specific comparison from the elements that are measurable (time, cost) with other frameworks.  He has misspellings (Universiades).  The use of the technique of extreme programming is mentioned, however, it is not specified how it was developed by the authors.  No SQL code is presented without specifying how it is related to the CakePHP framework.  The contribution of the presented screenshots is not clearly identified.  A more detailed introduction of the specific problem solved would be desirable. It is not clear what the benefits of using CakePHP are for the development of this application.  The conclusions are very general and are far from being specific to the developed work."

71,28,"A good topic, in terms of convening the society in the utilities and applications of the ICTs.

Unfortunately, none of the above could be done with studies that support the above. Value judgments are made without sufficient backing. There is no mention in the introduction of information from international bodies in the context of the proposal, such as the OECD or the World Economic Forum, among others.

72,28,"The theme of citizen participation is today one of the issues at the level of government that interests governments and citizens. The authors present an application that applies these concepts at the local government level.  The aim of the article is unclear. The authors declare that the project associated with this article aims to develop methods that provide social support for the participation of the citizens of Monteria in the processes and/or decisions of government .... On the other hand, they declare that the objective is to provide an architecture to support group and communications decision making, to facilitate citizen participation in those public decision-making processes, to promote their employment in important decisions, and to explore the political-legal aspects associated with it.  However, these objectives relate to the project as they do not develop in the article. The authors must make clear the objective of the article and must be circumscribed to what is presented in it.  The article also presents negative aspects related fundamentally to the review of the state of art or literature on the subject and on methodological development.  In relation to the review of the literature, the authors do not present the main studies in the field of citizen participation in the world. There is an important number of publications dealing with this issue in the United States and in Europe. The maturity models of e-government clearly address this area. Authors should review the literature on the subject in a comprehensive manner.  The methodological aspect of the article is incomplete since it does not establish a design of the research that clearly identifies the tools to be used at each stage and the justification for them (comparatively), only two alternatives are mentioned but the reasons for their elimination are unknown.   Since the work is still in its implementation stage, it is difficult to determine the final benefits of the implementation, so the authors should highlight this limitation."
73,29,"I don't think the work reported in this paper is suitable for the SCCC conference. The author should consider reporting this experience on a conference more focused on practice in computer engineering than in CS reserve. The material presented in the paper could be of interest for practitioners working with Oracle, namely a particular product."
74,29,"Subject well treated technically and clearly.  The theme only shows a technical handling of a tool, and it does not provide something novel. It is recommended to make a comparison in complexity to the SQL with primitive data versus XML data, and to cover other aspects such as improvement, etc."

The article basically is a review of the Xpath, Xquery and SQL/XML tools in Oracle 10g, illustrating its use with several examples.

76,30,"The article narrates the experience of developing a robotized solution for the industrial problem of electrical engine repair. In particular, the problem of making precision welding of electric motors by means of a robotic arm. The article presents practical aspects of solution development, complemented by illustrations that help to understand the problem and the process of developing the solution.  Understanding that this is a technology transfer experience to the specialized services industry supporting the main regional economic activity (mining), the following shortcomings were found: Aspects of form: 1. It is recursively incurred in non-technical terms, which confuse and do not provide objective background, as well as writing and spelling failures. For example: child failures -- > simply must be ""failures"" optimal results -- > if you use ""optimal"" you must provide evidence that supports that is the best solution and there is no better one. Fairly high failure rate -- > it is preferable to indicate that the estimated failure rate is 55% (5/ 9). ""quite high"" is ambiguous. solda? as required -- > as required as General Electric, with very good results -- > as General Electric, with good results.  2. always use third person.  this delivered us -- > this delivered what we got is the next -- > what was obtained was the next 3. It is not relevant to mention certain companies to which certain studies were purchased or commissioned: MOTOFIL, INDURA 4. It is assumed that the reader knows the terms and is able to identify pieces such as coils and switches from the figures. This should not be assumed, and should be explained clearly and simply, and illustrate its position in the figures where electric motors are shown. Names such as Innova Chile and its role in the project should be explained on foot.  5. Figure 6 is relevant in the explanation. Unfortunately, it is unreadable and this must be corrected.  6. use global achievable terms more than local. For example, cost close to 1 million pesos (Chileans?) -- > cost equivalent to U$ 2,000 approx.  7. Graph 1 (must be Figure 4): uniform font sizes and indicate the variable in the X axis. Background aspects: 1. a background section is missing that allows to understand later terms that are used later without having previously defined/explained. In this sense, there is a paragraph that explains what a robot is, but it appears within the Robotization section of the Soldering Process, so it is poorly located. It must be before the other elements of the background.  2. When explaining how the programming of the robot was performed, a drawing or figure that supports the explanation (reference plane, user plane, tool plane, etc.) is missing. The same is true for the explanation of why an optical sensor was added (add a drawing or illustrative figure).  3. Claims are made that are not supported by references to studies or documents. Conversely, references are not cited within the body of the article.  4. review the English version of the summary. There are several drafting and grammar errors.  5. there is no technical information in detail on how the robot programming steps were performed, for example. There are only general descriptions."
77,30,"It is an excellent research work of technological application, linked with an area company, very appropriate article for Infonor has flaws with respect to a traditional article, no related works, citations, references, etc. He has drafting problems, but it is clear in what he presents. It has long sentences and there are scoring issues. It would have to be adapted to pass the review of the magazine."
78,30,"This is a work that shows the experience of incorporating a robot to perform welds on an Antofagasta company.  The incorporation of technology is important in the Company and I think it is important for companies to trust the universities to do so. It is an important topic to review in the days.

81,31,"It is a job well done without a doubt, the author says he makes a contrast in various organizations on the subject.  There is a lack of history in relation to the ERP investigated. The model that he poses is not novel, it is rather logical and practical. It's a normal investigation and his input is regular. I believe that an analysis such as this requires a deeper analysis in economic and financial aspects, because the decisions for the acquisition of these types of tools are: operational, economic and financial."

83,32,"Abstract: Needs to have a definition of ERP-can't assume the reader knows what this means.  Intro: Avoid 1 sentence paragraphs (page 1) The introduction is rather long-it seems to actually be two different sections: an introduction (1st four paragraphs) and 1 + page of background and hypothesis. Overall-at 1.5 pages the intro is rather long for a paper that is 4 pages total.  Methodology: I think there are a lot of assumptions in regards to what ERP are and how they work.  While the paper is a statistical study, it would have benefited with a context of current example.  The samples are from small to medium size companies (how many?) with 49 use case (how do these relate?).  Results: Discussion is too limited-it assumes that a reader is very familiar with the area, and that may not be the case."
84,33,"The article presents a study of the perception of requirements engineers (novels and experts) regarding the effectiveness of different techniques of education for the discovery of requirements in a software development project.  The article deals with an issue that deserves some attention in the face of the large number of construction techniques that exist and the disorientation of the requirements engineers to use in a given context.  The study considered as novels Engineers who have no knowledge of techniques of education and one of the attributes that must be qualified as the basis of the comparative study, is precisely their experience. In fact, it is stated that ""a broader formation and mainly of a practical type, is necessary for the novice engineers to decide ...."", that is from Perogrullo. It should be considered a greater range of context attributes such as those suggested in [14], which allow for more truthful conclusions."
85,33,"It is a study conducted under a formal methodology (sandwich technique). The objective behind the study is to improve the preparation of strategies for training in requirements education techniques, which is a contribution given the relevance of the Engineering of Requirements in the development of software. The study covers a wide variety of construction techniques, including the most widely used in practice.  The study was applied to people belonging to a single institution (Universidad Politécnica de Madrid), without a doubt this is a limiting factor since all have exactly the same training, it would be interesting to apply the study to new engineers with different formations. The conclusions obtained from the study are not novel, they confirm what could be expected by logic."

The various stages involved in the challenge to provide high bandwidth to those observatories located in non-populated areas (full desert) are presented for their expeditious connection with various academic networks and the European astronomical community which is a good challenge from the technological point of view.  It would be important to stress because of the need to have large band widths, that is to describe in greater detail the type of traffic that justifies it, for example, monitoring, control and remote operation, etc.  Link is not yet in operation"

89,35,"The article performs a performance comparison for GPU-based and CPU-based implementations for the same algorithm. GPUs programming is a very current topic on HPC.  There are problems in the presentation of the article and the images are not well contextualized.  Implementations and performance comparisons between GPU and CPU are an issue already addressed in existing jobs.  The article describes in a relatively specific way the implementation and its details, in conjunction with the problems encountered.  The GPU programming theme is a very current topic in high-performance computing and its comparison with CPU-based programming seems relevant to me.  It would be advisable to improve the order of the article, relating the images and tables in a better way. There are obvious misspellings within the content of the work."
90,35,"The manuscript involves the use of GPU, technology that for a couple of years has more and more to say in the area of HPC. The document has relatively good structure, comparisons are made and there are some interesting graphics.  The document has some shortcomings that make it confusing, for example, page 7 is a complete mess, Figure 7 is not well explained, tables are treated as figures, there is a difference between what an image and a graph represents, so they should be treated independently. There is a text that explains Figure 6, which by the way is a table, that text is not part of the body of paper, or yes?, it is very difficult to read that page. I am not an expert in the SIFT algorithm, so reading the paper it is not clear to me whether they used the SiftGPU code created by Changchang Wu or took it as a base and applied some modifications.  On the other hand, it would have been interesting to know why the implementation in CUDA, the implementation in multicore and the serial could yield different results, if in the end the three approaches are the algorithm SIFT. More than 12 years ago, I programmed parallel applications and for the same algorithm never observed different results, if after all the algorithm is the same, now, when variants are introduced to the original algorithm in order to force the parallelism, different results are produced, but it is no longer the original algorithm.  Reading other papers on the subject, I don't find so much originality, the document doesn't help much to draw conclusions either.  The paper has data on runs and compares different approaches, but I have the great doubt why the same algorithm with a sequential approach and another parallel with GPU can produce different results.  GPU is a matter that has its thanks, especially for the saving in money that implies its use in the long term, so it could be good to divulge this work to divulge this technology.  The document is messy, it is missing to differentiate what is a figure, from a chart and from a table, besides page 7 is very difficult to read and the explanation of the data tables is confused with the body of the paper."
91,36,"The article generally proposes an architecture based on the Windows Azure platform to develop applications for Cloud Computing, which is a very current paradigm in computing technologies.  You would appreciate some indicators or comparisons of why using Windows Azure and not other platforms for applications in Cloud Computing.  The use of Windows Azure for the development of an application for Cloud Computing does not seem very original to me and the architecture raised is based on MVC, which is widely used in the area of application development.  The article describes in a very general way the concepts of Cloud Computing, MVC, Web Services, and REST.  The topic of Cloud Computing is a current paradigm of computing, and from that point of view, the article is relevant.  It would be appreciated to define the acronyms at least once, to define whether the ""cloud"" or ""the cloud"" will be spoken, references in the section of ""Proposed Architecture"" and some figures that will show the proposed architecture."
92,36,"-Description of the Windows Azure cloud platform components. -A description of the concept of cloud computing.   -Lack discussion regarding possible disadvantages or adverse scenarios of a ""cloud implementation""-The summary talks about ""... detailing the experience in building a platform to build public and open cloud"" but is only limited to the description of the Azure platform. -Very deep in the description of the application that was mounted on the cloud platform. Given the title and summary, more analysis is expected in terms of the advantages and disadvantages of development using this platform. -Problems of drafting within the same work. -Certain sections seem more of a commercial ""brochure"" than academic work."
93,36,"The paper has a relatively coherent structure, introduces a series of concepts that for someone who does not know the subject could be useful, speaks about architectural patterns and describes windows azure. For someone who knows the subject it is tedious to read definitions already known, on the other hand, the title of the paper is not consistent with the writing in the manuscript, in fact it gave me the feeling of being reading a commercial booklet more than a scientific work, cloud computing and especially its implementations, as for example windows azure have advantages and disadvantages, to mention some disadvantages: loss of control, performance, privacy, in Latin America all countries have serious bandwidth problems, so cloud computing can constitute a risk rather than a benefit but improves a basic aspect, improve the data networks. I think the case should have been explained more, since it is the essence that is evident if cloud computing is useful or just another buzzword that wants us to sell the commercial area of the IT companies. The paper is mainly limited to explaining concepts and benefits rather than showing the benefits and qualities by an example or a practical case.  The practical case is not detailed and the development of applications is not seen from a critical point of view, only positive aspects are mentioned and not the negative ones.  Although cloud is a current term, after participating in several grid computers and collaborative systems, I am not yet clear if cloud is a commercial area buzzword or if it really has something new that did not have the concepts that were coined before, although a critical and objective view of the topic was lacking, in parts it looks like a commercial brochure, I think an open discussion of the topic can be generated to help answer the doubts that exist around the term cloud computing.  The paper has editorial errors in the summary, however, it has coherence and an evolution of the theme, although the theme in which it evolves is not aligned with the title of the document."
94,37,"The paper introduces a segmentation procedure for breast tissue images using SVM.  General comments: a) Concerning the proposed approach: The segmentation method introduced only considers local color/gray value information. Perhaps introducing other features related to the membrane's local (e.g. the membrane has symmetry properties that can be exploited) or global (e.g. continuity, approximately circular shape) properties may improve the segmentation results.  Feature selection is also a key component to improve performance. Use a feature selection procedure.  b) Concerning the experience: You should describe the experiments with sufficient detail so others can replicate them: a) Make your data publicly available b) Explain how you have selected the classifier's parameters (parameter selection in an SVM is critical and may improve notably the performance).  You should join Figs 10 and 9 in a single plot so we can better see the differences.  You only provide qualitative segmentation results (Figs. 12, 14, 15), but quantitative results are also very important. Specifically when it comes to comparisons. You should quantitatively compare your algorithm with other competing works in the literature.  c) Concerning paper organization: The paper is well written and clearly introduces the problem, describes the relevant literature and presents the solution. I have a few comments concerning the paper organization: a) Problem statement and literature review (intro and theoretical framework sections) are in my opinion a bit long, compared to other important sections, e.g. feature extraction and experiment which are just one paragraph each. b) Although English is in general correct, there are some small mistakes that could be solved by having it read by a professional. c) There are two ""proposed method"" sections Well written paper. Good literature review.  It only shows very preliminary results."
95,37,"This paper shows a method of segmentation of images of breast tissue for the binary classification of pixels of an image using SVM, to determine the presence or absence of the staining of the membranes of cancer cells. This work is interesting and valuable, due to the difficulty of obtaining this type of images and the interdisciplinary approach, presenting an interesting future work. It is well written and the results shown even though partial seem correct and justified.  Verify the wording and typography of page 4 in its first and last paragraphs. The main weakness of this work may be the low amount of test images and the lack of comparison with other methods. It would also be desirable to show overall results of the classification and not just of the validation process. In addition, the properties explained in the score table (completeness and intensity) are not directly used in the classification process."
96,37,"The paper presents a medical test based on images of tissue sections. The approach proposed to cancer cells segmentation (membrane localisation) is based on local pixel features and SVM classification.  The paper describes quite well the practical problem it deals with (cancer cells segmentation on images) and it is generally well written.  -The paper approach described in the paper seems a first try on the problem and follows others in a quite similar (but new) problem. Moreover, the paper concludes that the proposed approach is not good enough.  -The features used for classification packs of frequency information around each pixel (although it used the first derivative with excess). Most text descriptors in the literature use frequency information from gabor wavelet, fourier coefficients, DCT, etc. Why not use this kind of information? Why you have chosen this 7 features and not other ones? The paper tracks of experimental evaluation on different features sets."

99,38,"It is proposed to use the GAIA methodology for traceability to the requirements, the proposed approach is based on the social capacity of the agents to process knowledge, to perceive the changes of the environment and communication. This is a complex task, because in the development of software a wide variety of models and diagrams are used that facilitate the representation of knowledge, these artifacts are modified in time. These changes come mainly from the user.  It is necessary to deepen the practical implementation of the proposal to better assess the scientific and practical contribution."

A good starting point may be the special issue of the journal: Computer Vision and Image Understanding Volume 98, Issue 1 (April 2005) Special issue on eye detection and tracking The experimental part of the work is very brief. It is important to describe in detail the data used in the experimentation, what the conditions of capture are, and even to make them public so that other researchers can compare with them. As for the results, it is not enough to give a percentage of correct answers. The false positives and negatives must be analyzed and related to the technique used and, if possible, with the future topics to be investigated.  Other comments: In the article it is mentioned that the speed of response has been considered, but no figures are provided.  The introduction cites the reference [3] in the related review on the psychological aspects of the article, when this reference seems to be of mathematical morphology.  Some references are incomplete: + In the 1 and 2 the editorial + in the 3 is missing the speaker/magazine. + In 5 the volume, number and pages The article addresses a topic of great technical and practical interest.

108,42,"This paper shows the results of the development of a CBIR based on the indices of metric distances, comparing it with existing systems through the accuracy of recovery and comparing the efficiency results in time for different indexing approaches such as GNAT, NAT, etc. The work addresses an important problem of recovery systems, its structure is correct and the results appear to be based.  Perhaps the evaluation criteria are not enough to determine the superiority of one approach over another, although the authors recognize the main shortcomings regarding this point and visualize future work in this direction. The explanation of section 2.3, on accuracy, is unclear in defining how it is known about the correct images more similar to a query to be able to calculate the accuracy. The time charts in Figure 3 do not indicate the scale."
109,42,"The article discusses building image recovery systems based on the content (of the images), CBIR. The CBIR problem is introduced and some algorithms are presented that allow to speed up the searches of neighbors closest to an input vector (corresponding to an image) in the chosen feature space to represent the images.  Color-based features, the response in frequency, and global are used for each of the local boxes in which an input image is divided. This introduces information of different types to the CBIR system to represent the images.  -The article does not clearly delimit its contributions. It seems that something is brought about as far as the feature space in which the images are represented and it also seems to bring something into the algorithms and data structures needed to speed up searches in metric spaces.  -In general the article uses little space to explain the proposed approach to CBIR (two references to master's thesis are given). In the conclusions, experimental results are presented, when they should clearly go in a previous section with the experiments.  -As for the visual characteristics used to represent an image: There is a lack of experiments that allow to establish what each one of the characteristics that it proposes to use. This is, I think it's important to answer the question Why are you and not others? and also to the question Is it any redundant and could be stopped using? While it is true that a feature selection procedure is used, there is less an experiment setting out what the effect of the selection is. How much is gained in rate of success on the use of the complete vector?  It seems that the feature space after the selection has a dimension of 3078 (section 2.4). Is this or the 3078 features extracted ""manually""?  -The comparison experiment of CBIR systems is not understood (section 2.3). What is done with the 100 images common to the databases? Is the same query done on all systems, and accuracy and recall are measured using only the 100 common images when they appear or not in the system response? That's not explained at all in the article.  -When given a data such as sensitivity and specificity in the conclusions, it has to be said about which data set has been tested. It is possible to test some data and obtain a completely different result on others. Therefore, sensitivity and specificity without reference to the data that has been obtained are meaningless.  -This reviewer finds it that an article on CBIR should not overlook developments in Vision by Computer based on local (already classic) features such as: Sivic, J. and Zisserman, A. Video Google: A Text Retrieval Approach to Object Matching in Videos Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (2003) D. Nister and H. Stewenius, Scalable recognition with a vocabulary tree Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (2006)-Some of the references, such as the [10,11,13], are incomplete What do they refer to?

110,42,"The publication aims to show the benefits that metric structures have for image recovery. This work is the continuation of several works already presented, such as for example. [1] ""Parallel metrics in the recovery of images"", Peña-Jaramillo, E. (Referred to in the paper) [2] ""Definition of a Recolator of Images based on Contents on Metric Spaces"", Eduardo Peña-Jaramillo, et al. (Not referenced). [3] ""Parallel Metrics in the Recovery of Images on the Web"", Eduardo Peña-Jaramillo, et al. (Not referenced).  On the number [1] reference it has not been possible to obtain an electronic copy, and since the aforementioned publications [2] and [3], it can be said that there is a new contribution in the experiments carried out on GNAT and Spaghetis structures. It should be explained in the publication that the work is not original from the point of view of the author, and that its extension is based on the work [1], [2], [3] or another that has direct relation to the work presented.  -The text is well structured and it is easy to understand what you want to expose. -Well in the presentation, there are no serious problems. Only improve the figures of the graphs, especially the tildes, in matlab you can add text in latex to avoid these kinds of problems. The word ""more"" appears on a couple of occasions without tilde.  -In the section of ""Introduction"" although the work is presented in general, I think it would be important to point out what the state of art is in these matters. Are there related works? Are there important references? What is the contribution of work on the state of art?, etc. A more comprehensive literature review is lacking. -In the section of ""Extraction of characteristics"" I have found some details such as:-It has cost me to find a definition about the technique of layout since there is only one reference [1], so I intuit that the characteristics obtained from each sub-image have been considered as a signal which are mixed to obtain the vector that represents the total image, as it says in the text: ""The union of all the characteristics extracted gives us as a result ..."", where it is not clear the type ""union"" that takes place.  -The same is also true when reference is made to the Fisher discriminant, once again [1]. A more relevant source should be added for this point. -The type of database used is not explained in detail. Is it public or private domain? What type of images or groups of images it contains. How many are there by class? Are there repeated images? Quality of the images. The idea is to have a frame of reference so that anyone who wants to compare their algorithms with their own makes them on a level playing field. -From the images shown in Figure 2, I can deduce which database (I hope to be wrong) has repeated images that can produce a bias when calculating the values of precision, sensitivity and specificity of the recovered images. I believe that the ideal database for correctly measuring the quality of the recovery should have different images, even if they are the same, but never the same. Since when retrieving a set of images on a query, if they are repeated, the amount of true positives will be proportional to the repeated which will translate into a bias on the calculation of the metrics.  Recommendations-The text mentions (conclusions section) that the solutions are not entirely satisfactory. I think there are currently projects like http://similar images.googlelabs.com/, images.googlelabs.com/, http://www.like.com/, http://www.like.com/, http://www.tineye.com/, others; that show a great advance in this field and it would be good to be checked.  -On the other hand, on the set of features used I recommend to review other types of features that have been shown to be invariant to scale and rotation.

112,43,"The article promises to present a method to measure the quality of software development at SCRUM.  I consider the proposal interesting and relevant, however the work has weaknesses in its construction.  The title promise is diluted in abstract eL and introduction, with the ""introduction"" of SPEM as a tool. Then in the article body there is no clear link between SPEM and the proposed quality measurement method.  Nor is the case for study on which they are basing their work clear. The modeling in SPEM is on SCRUM in theoretical form in the case of study. The evaluation of the method does not seem to measure the quality of the software, but the criteria of those involved with respect to the attachment to the modeling process. And in any case, it always measures intermediate documents of the process and not defects or first attributes of the quality of the software produced.  Minor Comments:-Review Building of References-SCRUM modeling does not include the retrospective meeting. If a particular SCRUM implementation is being modeled, clarify it in the paper body. Otherwise it is an important modeling error. -Why do they use a traditional process to model an agile process? Could not one of the latter have been used? -In the first sheet, at the end of the first column, the typeface changes."

115,46,"SUMMARY. The job describes the steps to follow to apply fuzzy logic concepts on mobile devices. To exemplify the steps to be followed, the author used a mobile robot called AMADEUS (similar to the cleaning robots marketed in Japan [1]). To apply the concepts of fuzzy logic, Mamdani module was used.  General Assessment. The subject is an interesting and very recurring sum of late. Devices that use fuzzy logic to operate is a very interesting and novel bridge between Artificial Intelligence and ""pervasive computing"". However, this work has at least one major weakness that should be resolved: 1) At work it doesn't show because it's really important to use fuzzy logic. An application example is strongly recommended for the job In which would you help to use fuzzy logic on mobile devices?  2) At work it is not very clear to me whether the use of fuzzy logic on mobile devices is something new in this area. If it is not something new, perhaps the job could only become a repetition of another job. If it's something new, please mention it.  Minor Comments:-In the conclusions, the phrase ""was demonstrated"" is mentioned; it is suggested to change to ""it was shown"". -Take care of the uses of scores (e.g. ""..."", ""."") and the upper case. -At the end of the introduction, it is suggested to mention the structure of the document.

117,46,"The work, according to the reviewers, does not present a direct scientific contribution in the area of robotics or diffuse systems, however it is a very interesting application to be presented in the Workshop of Robotics of INFONOR 2013. This is why it is recommended to accept the article for presentation."
118,47,"This article proposes a system that adds fuzzy components to certain attributes of a database with information about the physical state of people.  The application of the work is interesting, since there are few experiences where in practice diffuse attributes are used for storage and consultation in our country, so it can make the subject matter interesting for our congress.  However, the following aspects, or are not clear or incomplete:-Use format requested by the congress. -Improve general wording of the summary/introduction-Compose third person point 3, 4.1.1 when referring to the client-Take care of the use of abbreviations that are sometimes used in lowercase or upper case-Compose the conclusion with an approach where it is clear what benefits the user obtained from the system with respect to a non-diffuse system-It is not clear how the functions of belonging used were determined. -There was some kind of study/comparative to check the contribution that a system like the proposed improvement or complements a traditional system in the area applied Due to the above, it is recommended to accept the article for presentation in the Workshop of business applications."
119,48,"A Learning Object serves as support for the educational process, to develop competencies in students in one of the three types of knowledge (conceptual domino, domain of procedures and development of attitudes and values).

This is why it is not recommended to accept the article, unless information is added to support the implementation of OA in this course."
121,49,"The article is interesting because of the thematic it addresses and the results of the analyses carried out, rather than the methodology itself.

125,51,"SUMMARY: The work recounts the steps taken to use SAP ERP software in Embonor, a producer and distributor of Coca-cola products.  Before reporting this experience, this company already had some SAP modules implemented (Financial, FI-CO, Logistics, Human Resources).  General Assessment. Although the work does not present a scientific structure of an article, it is extremely interesting (in my opinion) to listen in more detail to this experience in infonor 2013. Perhaps, I would recommend adding/presenting a bit more about the assessments this implementation (in their conclusion, they mention this as a future job).  Minor Comments:-Mainly take care of the spacing between words and points. -Figure 1 is very little sharp. -Figure 4 says: ""Menus of table xx (standard on each SAP screen)"" xx?"
126,52,"General comments: • There is talk of a template, however in no part of the article appears this template • It is recommended that an example of data collection can be included in the template • Adding analyzed data graphs can support in a better understanding of the analysis that was performed. • Review all the writing as there are many inconsistencies in the writing for example: articles of more or missing words • Review the spacing of the paragraphs • There is very little bibliography • Review that the indentations used as the beginning of the paragraph are in accordance with the format of the congress • Review the format of the references bibliographic comments by sections Key words: • Review the keywords: ... case study, ISO 9126 Introduction • General ....? → Generally or Generally C.

127,52,"The document attempts to display an evaluation of software quality attributes based on the ISO 9126 standard. The document shows a proposal for a template with a series of questions to analyze the quality of different quality attributes of a developed software product. However, the document lacks structure. The wording is deficient. Some parts of the document do not follow the required format parameters in the authors ' guide. For example, the abstract (abstract) is centered and according to the event guide should be justified. In the same way some paragraphs of the document are presented. As for the wording, the document is difficult to read, missing or poorly placed the punctuation marks. The keywords do not match as keywords in the article. There is a lack of bibliographic references to support the claims made. Even though the template can be as useful as they try to ensure at work, it is necessary to seek a more consolidated validation that allows to ensure its usefulness. The statistics presented lack valid justifications and the presentation format is deficient. Much of the paper focuses on making statements described in the ISO 1926 standard and: 1. It is not properly cited as the main reference of the work. 2. Focusing the article to summarize the definition of each feature or subcharacteristic of the standard does not seem very appropriate for this type of work. The presentation format of the template lacks clarity. It appears to be a questionnaire format but is not displayed as such. There is a list of unclear statements and questions. Some of these questions are mentioned in the results, however they do not appear in the list called by the author as ""plantila"", is the case of: Does the system operate together with another system?. In general terms the work should refine much more."
128,52,"The article presents a case study of the application of a template to measure quality according to the ISO 9126 standard. While it is true to fit the scope of the event and its proposal may be of interest to software engineers who wish to have some practical instrument to apply in their quality systems, the work has serious deficiencies that must be improved to be published.  The technical presentation of the document has shortcomings that do not meet the standards set for writing the article. In particular, we can mention some:-The format is not uniform as can be seen in the abstract that has different settings in its extension. There are also differences in the space after each paragraph. Sometimes it exists and sometimes it doesn't. The vignettes have different bloody ones. Bibliographic references have different indentations.  -The most serious is spelling and writing. The document requires a thorough editing review. In only the first two paragraphs of the introduction I have found more than 5 faults.  With regard to its structure I believe it must be reorganized to improve its presentation. I believe that the objectives must be within the framework of the introduction. The presentation of the ISO criteria should be summarized in a descriptive table. It's latefully extensive and I think it can be referenced for details. On the other hand, I think it should be clarified whether the template is pre-existing or is a work proposal, in which case it should be highlighted as it would be the main contribution of the article. Your presentation is unfortunate. I think it should be summed up in a table and clearly stipulate what can be answered. Most are not even presented as questions. I insist that if the template is the contribution it should be facilitated by other engineers. Your presentation does not help this. (for example the first, "" When interacting with the system, identify how predictable it turns out to be "": what answer?) The instrument should be self-contained so that it clearly contains a guide for its application. More so, it doesn't provide clarity to know how it combined responses to queries to get a quality metric. I think there is too much work left for the reader.  The results are not presented in a readable form. I think a table would help. Even, it mentions several times the tabulation of the results but this does not appear. As is a case study I would like to see in that table the answers that were obtained and how the percentages that measure quality were calculated."
129,53,"Presents a response search from a request in a call center.  The work is well presented, but very long, and that does not allow us to see well what the authors want to contribute."
130,54,"It is an interesting application, only that there are measures such as averages that are not additive, so the design must be corrected, because the system results can be erroneous (not to use to make decisions until the averages are removed, these must be constructed at each level of role up)."
131,54,"This work addresses an interesting subject, but it is very poorly presented.  Starting with the summary, which ends with a really incomprehensible paragraph: ""Every result is possible to the good modeling of the data to then execute the ETL process and thus end exploiting them with an OLAP tool"".  The Introduction does not improve; it starts with a ""Nace like this ..."", which is the first sentence, which does not correspond, since by style it seems to be the continuation of another idea.  Point II, Theme, appears as a good opportunity to account for the state of art, but it is used to group a set of definitions, without it being clear that they are part of a whole that the author will use as a basis for developing his proposal.  Point II, Analysis of the problem, is reduced to the processing of the data.  The author once again misses an opportunity to raise the problem and highlight the impact of his proposal.  The text contains an important amount of misspellings, which do not hinder the comprehension of the writing, but which show a lack of prolijity in writing.  In VI Exploitation of indicators, important space is allocated to the first indicator: average age ...  Being the values obtained quite close in all regions, what does that data actually serve?  More accurate revisions of a text that does not meet the expected quality standards are required."
132,54,"1. What is proposed is interesting as an application but it is not a scientific work.  2. It is no longer interesting to apply a Datamart from a technical point of view as presented by the author, since there is a lot of documentation and work on it.  3. The author should look for other ways if she wants to investigate the area.  4. There are design errors in the measures of the fact table. So it is possible that some results may not be good."
133,54,"The article, according to the reviewers, is not a scientific contribution, but the subject is particularly interesting to discuss in our congress. This is why it is recommended to accept the article for presentation in the business application workshop instead of regular paper."
134,55,"This article presents a Comparative Analysis of Maturity Models in Business Intelligence, showing the DEA and MESME techniques to perform this analysis. Even if the method is clear, it is not understood whether the resulting model is selected for any organisation, i.e. if it is general.  You should use Business Intelligence, rather than Business Intelligence.  These models are surely defined for large companies in the United States, so they work equally in Chilean companies? The maturity in Business Intelligence in companies from developed countries is different from countries like Chile.  It is not necessary to include point II alone.  In point V, paragraph 2, indicates that a DEA adaptation is described and does not specify the reference or if it is an adaptation proposed by the authors, as well as indicating why an adaptation is used.  On page 4, the first paragraph indicates that the Hierarchy model is excluded and then checked in again in the following steps.  On page 5, point E, it is not clear why the output should be increased by 10% in order to increase efficiency. In the letter F you must change the word 'we can' and in the second paragraph it seems that the table to reference is 5 and not 6.  You should describe the elements of the equation (3).  In point B, of VI, it is not understood why the IS model was selected, if it had less efficiency.  In Figure 6, the graphs of each model are not clear. In points V and VI the steps label them with numbers and then describe them with letters.  You must use an equation editor.  The item does not have the format specified for this and is more than 8 pages. On page 7 when you include the table produces a mismatch in the text to fix."

Then, when the qualitative analysis was done, work was done with 6 methodologies and not 5, including the one already discarded.  On page 2 he says ""This research aims to identify ..."". The goal is not to ""identify"" but ""perform a comparison to select ..."".  In Section IV, there is a systematic review, but it does not make any reference to this work previously carried out.

By way of example, we quote the phrase ""While computational technology advances by leaps and bounds it is important these days to optimize programming in a better way in order to obtain better results, that is why we have given the use of algorithms inspired by biological systems, since they present a greater optimization than the use of conventional heuristics""; 3.

It presents some minor problems in a way that must be solved:-incorrect enumeration of the figures and does not follow the order of appearance. -reference 2 is incomplete According to the above, the proposed algorithm exceeds other algorithms of the literature as to percentage of BKS achieved. However, we do not discuss the average relative error factor% and the fact that the proposed scheme exceeds 2 schemes of the literature but is exceeded by 5 others (this is mentioned in the conclusions but without discussion). It would be appropriate to introduce a discussion on the latter and future work in this regard."
139,57,"Lack of support in the validation of the proposal.  There is no analysis of how this proposal improves or complements traditional requirements traceability techniques.  It seems to me that proposing such an extensive code rather than facilitating traceability makes it more cumbersome, unless a software tool that automatically generates these codes is used, which is not considered in the proposal.  The case study presented is merely descriptive, there is no support to validate whether improvements were actually achieved with respect to the use of traditional traceability techniques."
140,58,"It is not clear whether the article presents a proposal of own process assessment (based on CMMI or ISO), an adaptation of concepts present in the norms to a concrete process or a case study on a development plan.  The combination of the CMMI and ISO models has been widely discussed in the literature. However, no bibliographic references on this subject are included. Nor is it explained in the article what is the approach used to combine the concepts of both. It is necessary to include new bibliographic references on this topic and others related to quality models and processes.  The definition of phases and products of the process seem arbitrary and are not justified in the article. The phases that are presented do not always match the proposals in the state of the software engineering practice. The authors must give, at least, an explanation of how they are obtained.  The article has several problems of non-uniform format, some paragraphs present a different interline, some section titles are in bold and some do not.  The study does not provide any interesting results regarding the application of these quality concepts and processes in the case of INAPI."
141,58,"This article presents to measure the quality of software processes. The title was already something that surprised me. There are thousands of debates in which quality is understood in software processes and the authors do not specify which basis they are based on. Furthermore, the classification that they make in the sections from the stages of development, the processes of development is something of which there are many alternatives in the literature and the authors focus on one that seems to give or to take as the most appropriate referent. The practical vision in the specific case of INAPI is of interest, but I think it would have been more important to say why things are applied than to try to define a global view and as a standard of the concepts with which I work. On the other hand, there are other methodological proposals to apply 9001 in the context of the software. I believe that it should be more appropriate to promote the one that is being defended in reality."

Secondly, it is said that references will be made from 2008 onwards as a priority, but many of its references are from before that date, and that is not uncommon, since between 2001 and 2004 there is an explosion of works in this specific area. Third, no major impact area conference work has been explicitly included in the scientific community as AMCIS or ECIS (the former has a private database, not accessible by google and the second is free). -The above limitations restrict the scope of the interesting results presented at work."

On the other hand, and in relation to the conclusions, I think that while in UTAUT 2 FC is a background of BI, this is only in the context of consumer technologies, and I do not think it is a useful comparison in the e-learning context, I suggest looking for references in that context.

150,66,"SUMMARY. The article seeks to show the applications of Biological Immune Systems in computing. To this end, the article begins by describing the theory on the biological immune system of vertebrates, which it defines, as well as explaining its functioning. He then describes the biological models as a theoretical review of the matter. It finally describes the characteristics of artificial immune systems and details the different fields of application.  General Assessment. The subject of the article is extremely interesting, and rarely seen (at least by me). As the article postulates, it does a bibliographic review of the theory and gives a description of the variety of applications this field of study has. It manages to summarize these concepts that can effectively serve as a frame of reference within the literary. However, the article has some weaknesses: 1) The great weakness of the article is its structure. The article does not follow the standard format of the work of a scientific article. Here are some examples. a) The introduction does not present the structure that follows the article, nor a general idea of what the authors want to achieve. (b) There is no line of the ideas of each section, nor one introduction per section. This means that there is no clear proposal from the authors and that they try to propose it is seen only on the last page.   2) Another weakness is that it does not establish any way to evaluate and compare the different applications of the subject in order to connect them with the theory and present a contribution of the article. For this reason, it does not comply with its abstract: ""... To establish guidelines in the application of these techniques in the different areas of knowledge. "" 3) Another problem is that it does not establish any type of conclusion or the implications of the article, which ends with the description of an application in combinatorial optimization.  Other comments. Minor drafting problems: a) ""... and the molecules belonging to external antigens (not their own), which in the last are the ones that constitute a threat to the organism ..."" It is understood that a word is missing after ""last"". b) ""describes basic characteristics of an immunological response"" This sentence does not establish a definition. c) ""innate immune cells specialized dendritic cells"" Here are also missing words."

153,68,"The article presents a proof of concept regarding sound association to a financial index (RSI).  The article has an adequate structure, presents the concepts, related work and the proposal of ""sonification"" in clear form. However, it is spout in the description of the implementation, the results obtained and its analysis.  Some minor grammatical errors:-p. 1, right column, first paragraph. ""Is in this context""-pag. 3, right column, second paragraph. ""minimums and maximums frequencies ...""; ""to void damaging ...""  Some aspects to be improved: It is not clear what the advantage might be with regard to other possible ways to associate sound with the RSI.  Further explanation and detail regarding implementation is required.  The work lacks an empirical part where the value of the proposed scheme can be judged or estimated against other possible options. This is explained by its proof-of-concept character, but this is not mentioned as future work."
154,69,"An impeccable job.   Well presented, focusing on a topical and interesting topic. Ameno and well structured.  No comments from me. I think it's a real input that will captivate the interest of the attendees.  The fact of using as a component element a tool of impact on social networks immediately captures the attention of the reader; and the presentation that starts with a look at the most relevant concepts seeks to clarify that this is a work within reach of those who participate in social networks.  While it can be read without difficulty by a wide range of readers, it does not lack the rigor necessary to be an attractive, consistent and well-posed proposition.

However long before social networks, the Internet and the latest technological advances, consumer behavior was already observed and investigated by different areas of knowledge. Thus, to study the marketing of word of mouth, one of the oldest and most reliable records applied to social networks is of great importance. Understanding social networks and their multiple variety is making it possible to expand studies through other dimensions. The use of the correlations and the adopted model opens the possibility of their use in other realities, other countries. For these reasons, it seems appropriate to recommend the article according to the criterion of ""strongly accepted"" when complying with the methodological rigor, to extend the questions, to test a model and to arouse interest for other researchers."

161,73,"The work ""Leadership in IT adoption in SMEs Only the involvement of the owner matters?"" explores through the AI methodology the relationship between owner involvement and the success of IT in SMEs. While it is a good job, the text can be improved in some aspects of form and background: 1. The authors must declare the objective of the study to facilitate the reading of the work. 2. Unfortunately the authors make a major mistake in placing D&M as an individual acceptance model (""Other individual acceptance models include: the DeLone and McLean model (D&M) [5]""). In fact, from that error the wording of the text confuses dimensions of the success of the use of information systems (the model D&M) with models of adoption of information technologies (TAM and successors). The authors should review D&M and see the implications for their work of the correct interpretation of this model. 3. Associated with the above, what do the authors understand for the success of the use of information systems? Should the individual benefits and the benefits organizations be part of them?, is it possible that other dimensions of the success of the use of information systems, such as the quality of information and the quality of service of the computer function, are important variables to explore in the two projects studied?"

So it is appropriate to cite it as a reference or to make the contributions or substantive differences, as does http://www.reuna.cl/documentos/DOC2008/KawaxAstronomia_nov2008A2.pdf Finally, the article lacks relevance, since the contributions do not differ from what it presents.   Moreover, the figures are not explained, nor is the source cited in http://www.ivoa.net/documents/Notes/IVOAArchitecture/.   There is no doubt that what is relevant will be the results obtained from the project (FONDEF D11I1060, awarded in 2011), in the sense of the design and implementation of a virtual observatory, which must meet the standards of IVOA, however, for now, I do not see any substantive contributions.  In addition, the ""instances where they will present problems"" are not mentioned, either the ""problems they face"" as a community in the face of data processing that will be solved through ""computational techniques"", which are previously unknown.  On the other hand, the architecture shown and seems natural to me is that of IVOA, however, at least for now, the contributions that have been made in this regard are not shown."
163,74,"Interesting paper that shows the development of a virtual astronomical observatory with possible important implications for the national computer community. In this respect, it would be desirable for the presentation to clarify aspects such as is the participation of other universities to collaborate in the challenges arising from this project? Is it intended to work with more observatories in the future? What lessons or guides can be drawn from the experience in the implementation of the other virtual observatories around the world, and from the profit that researchers have taken from computer science?"
164,75,"It is an interesting application, however the KPIs should not be equivalent to the measures that will eventually remain in the fact table. For example, the average indicator of deaths per year, must be implemented through the measure ""number of deaths"" that is an additive measure and can be added by the different levels of the dimension (so you can get the average KPI per day, month, quarter, etc). There are several dimensions that are grouped in the model, being different (for example, mother-character). The layout must be corrected, the results obtained by the system may be in error."
165,75,"The article presents an analysis of fetal deaths in Mexico through a well-realized process of Business Intelligence (ETL-Datawarehouse-OLAP-KPI's). The weakness is found in the motivation of the study, since it is not clear how it arises and what it induces to do the study, the concern arises as to why in the UNAP a study is carried out that has to do with fetal deaths in Mexico, will the conclusions of the study have any impact on the public policies of this country? or is it just a job based on open data? It would have been appropriate to clear these doubts from a start in order to properly assess this work."

Moreover, the application of a Datamart from a technical point of view is no longer interesting, as it is presented by the author as there is a lot of documentation and work on it. For this reason we must now look for ""other aspects (design, methodology, etc.)"" that make interesting an article of the Datamart area. 2.

168,77,"-The topic is of scientific relevance. -In the work, an analysis of the literature on data quality was developed in the municipal e-government applications. -Methodologically there are three important limitations to overcome. First, the impact factor of the publications has not been considered, thus the development associated with this type of revisions has been rejected, mixing high impact jobs (example, articles of journals ISIs impact factor >2, like MISQ) with works without a quality review (example, what Scholar ""throws"" only to match in the search). Secondly, it is said that references will be made from 2008 onwards as a priority, but many of its references are from before that date, and that is not uncommon, since between 2001 and 2004 there is an explosion of works in this specific area. Third, no major impact area conference work has been explicitly included in the scientific community as AMCIS or ECIS (the former has a private database, not accessible by google and the second is free). -The above limitations restrict the scope of the interesting results presented at work. -Finally, it is suggested to advance the measurement scales of selected dimensions before developing case study indicated in the conclusions."
169,78,"The paper shows a practical application developed with augmented reality applied to deliver tourist information in open spaces. The work will allow the knowledge of the technology at national level and its potentialities, so it is considered a contribution. However, the paper lacks a comparative study with other similar works applying this technology to this same objective, so it is not possible to obtain an idea of the degree of originality of it, nor does it give the possibility to contrast some of the limitations of the same one that the author mentions at the end of the paper with previously developed works."
170,78,"The article presents a case study on the development of an augmented reality mobile app. The application aims to provide context-sensitive multimedia information (location) and allows for tours on different points of interest.  While the topic (Augmented Reality) is very interesting from the research point of view, the objectives of the case study should be explicitly presented. The objective of the prototype can be experimentation with development technologies available for RA, the development of a functional software to be put into production or both.  In the central section of the article (Proposed Solution) there are multiple sections where concepts are mixed: selection of tools, design of the application architecture, list of functionalities (which should be reviewed to be an extension of the requirements of section III). I suggest separating and selecting just one of these aspects to deal in greater depth. For example, the selection and justification of tools is scattered at various points in the article.  There is an opportunity to explain the lessons learned from developing an RA application in greater detail. The list of benefits and the discussion of results only deals with general aspects.  I suggest including more references to the literature on RA: definitions, recent research, cases of similar developments."

You don't respond to the indicators ... what is the point of that?  Citations in italics include the authors; lacking support from someone else experienced in writing the article.  Unfortunately, the work is riddled with unacceptable errors.  Not just writing.  Page 3 indicates that one of the problems encountered relates to the ""Data structure"". What is the problem? Why does it occur? How does the author face it? Is your approach satisfactory?  I believe that these background (which are repeated in a similar way throughout the text) justify my rejection.  In short, the job is very poor."

My main qualms are:-Figure 7 presents charts with 10-minute window, being that the proposal indicates 5 minutes-In my view the system does not represent a data mining process because there is no new actionable knowledge, but rather it is a classification system. There may be new knowledge, but the document does not reflect how the system realized helped gain new knowledge of the attacks. -There is little explanation and lack of experimentation to argue and justify the use of DBSCAN over another type of clustering or even rather than a classifier. -A SYN-FLOOD attack is known to produce a high number of connections at any given time, so it is not clear if such a sophisticated system is needed to detect this phenomenon, this could be clarified if comparative with other approaches were included."

For example: 1) typographical errors, such as ""fiscas"" in summary 2) Long and confusing phrases as in the first paragraph of the introduction and the last two of the left column on page 2.  3) Phrases that do not respect gender and number concordance, such as ""research is organized"" on page 2.  4) Table 2 is quoted before Table 1, there is no table 3, in Table 4 the percentages are wrong, and Table 5 is not quoted in the text, it contains very small intervals (it could put together the two intermediate age ranges) and works with fractional ages ... it is better to have less round percentages than split ages.  5) The text only has two sections: Introduction and Conclusion (which they called reflections).  6) References do not follow a single pattern."

This point is obvious in a mobile app because of its nature. * The conclusions do not contribute to the work done, a possible extension of the evaluation to larger mobile devices, for example: tables.  The proposed quality measurement process can only be evaluated in its application in different mobile applications, not only in one to improve the payment management of the federal taxes.

182,84,"The work has turned out to me interesting and it has seemed like a very attractive article to read. However, my main issue that I have advised against is because I do not really consider what is presented to be an investigation. The article presents an experience in the use of a mobile application for the payment of taxes but this is something that already has been running in other environments. What does this bring again? There is also some novelty in this development, but it has not been reflected in the paper. Even, the approaches of future research work raised, I understand them as evolutionary or new applications. The paper would be suitable for a track section but not for a research congress in my view."
183,85,"SUMMARY. The paper proposes a model for evaluating the quality of an agent-oriented software. Basically, the model considers three properties to evaluate its quality: social skill, autonomy and pro-activity.  To evaluate these properties, the author breaks down these properties into several measurable sub-properties. The author evaluates this model through a case study: a banking system.  General Comments: In a notary way, the structure of the document has the necessary aspects to be considered a scientific article. The contribution of the article seems to be relevant.  That said, this work lacks some points that (for me) it is important to address: * The author mentions that there is no model for evaluating the quality of the agent software, and he proposes one. His proposal is an ISO/IEC adaptation, however, the author does not justify why it is appropriate.  * With respect to the previous point, paragraph 1 of the introduction says that there is no model of measuring the quality of the software. Next, paragraph 2 mentions that there are some jobs about this. The author should clarify his contribution.  * The author mentions that a software was developed for this work, however, this work appears as another publication (and from another author). If it is the software mentioned is not part of the contributions of the work, please remove these phrases.  Other Comments: * In the case study section it is not so easy to understand it. For example, figures 2, 5 and 7 are not understood to be referred to (e.g. AMS). I guess they correspond to the sub-properties.  * It is recommended to exchange section 3 for section 2. That is, first explain that it is an agent and then talk about the related work.  * It is not clear to me whether it is ""software agent"" or ""software agent"". Even, the author also confuses this terminology (first sentence of section 4)."
184,85,"The paper presents an interesting proposal to evaluate the paradigm of development of agent-oriented software and although it is an ongoing work has good bases.

187,87,"This is a very particular article that proposes an extension to existing data models considering the idea of ""system"" (of objects). For this purpose a language (LATIN) and a universal data model, MED, based on a ""spherical volume"" with two ""major"" and ""daily"" poles based on accounting ideas, is proposed. This is, in my view, the most critical aspect of the proposal, as the doubt arises, whether every system should be silent in this scheme, or we are talking about a particular set of cases. Later ideas are interesting and, at least, generate a break with respect to the classic ideas of object orientation. I quote the idea of a proposed system: ""a system is a set of classes linked and inter-actuant according to the same method, which is not particular to each class but emerging from all of them"". Other ideas associate transaction with referential set, macros, types, instances, ... what in global terms constitute a new body of ideas. There are no references to any previous article by the author who deals with these ideas, but it seems to me that it may be interesting to hear this proposal and discuss it. In terms of formality, the article does not comply fully with the format of the congress, and the number of pages exceeds the eight requested."

For example, you can make a table with the advantages over other models, for example, relational database, object oriented, and distributed, ..., like those discussed in related jobs.  3.-It must be based on a model that exists to extend the proposed model and its notation.

This statement is incorrect because it is not shown to MED conceptually modeled what is the conceptual notation that is shown?  You must correct this by clearly stating what the notation is to occupy.  6.-In the case of the study of the page www.cootracolta.com there is nothing visible for which it is perhaps not good to indicate this website.  7.-The article should follow the patterns of articles that have proposed data models for example when the GOLD object oriented model was proposed for multidimensional modeling."
189,88,"SUMMARY. This paper describes three of the teaching activities in an elective course at La Serena University. Developing interpreters using the ANTLR tool on Android is the main connection of these activities. The first activity implements a parser/interpreter for a calculator. The second activity incorporates the ability to sort lists in the interpreter. The latest activity incorporates the voice recognition service using a Google bookstore. According to the work, the result of these activities allowed the students to better understand the concepts of formal languages.  General Evaluation: The work describes in a very clear way how the activities were carried out in the elective course. However, from my point of view, the work presents two great weaknesses: 1) The main motivation of the work is that the use of the ANTLR tools are useful for the formal language courses. However, a sample is never offered for why this statement is true, only detailed how to implement the software of the activities. It is strongly recommended to give real signals (e.g. justifications, experiments, etc.) of why these tools help the teaching of these topics.  2) This point is the cause of the previous point. There is no motivation or problem that clearly shows the need to use these tools for a language course. If the authors manage to find a clear and measurable motivation, point 1) can be solved.  Finally, the job fails to convince with its conclusion.  Minor Comments: 1) The job exceeds the required maximum number of pages (9 (> 8) pages). 2) In the conclusion it is stated that with the use of ANTLR in Android and knowledge of formal languages you can match the tools of Siri (Apple) & Google Now. In my opinion, that statement is not true, because to resolve the activities use the Google APIs, meaning that without Google products, these activities cannot be carried out. In short, ANTLR and the knowledge of formal languages are not enough to build Google Now. 3) It would be nice to use the canonical references of DSLs instead of those used in the job: @article{vanDeursen: 2000:DLA:352029.352035, author = {van Deursen, Arie and Klint, Paul and Visser, Joost}, title = {Domain-specific languages: an annotated bibliography}, journal = {June 2000}, volume = {35}, number = {6}, month = jun, year = {2000}, issn = {0362-1340}, pages = {26 -- 36}, numpages = {11}, url = {http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/352029.352035}, doi = {10.1145/352029.352035}, acmid = {352035}, publisher = {ACM}, address = {New York, NY, USA},} @article{Mernik: 2005:DDL:1118890.1118892, author = {Mernik, Marjan and Heering, Jan and Sloane, Anthony M.}, title = {When and how to develop domain-specific languages}, journal = {ACM Compute.

194,90,"The article is about the application of BPMN for the understanding of a business process in a mining company in Peru.  The document is well structured and its reading is easy. Few drafting errors are observed. In addition, its format is required by the congress.  In relation to the topic of the article, being an application of BPMN, it is not novel. From the case, I think it was possible to make a greater contribution, perhaps proposing a methodology to address the review of business processes, considering that the internal and external actors of the company, generally prioritize the optimization of their production processes more than the review of other processes. Last and not least, the emphasis of the article is the review (audit) of the process with BPMN, moving away from the topics of the congress. More emphasis could be placed on applications associated with the congress, such as analysis of requirements from BPMN, implementation of SOA from BPMN, monitoring of processes with BAM and BPMN, etc.  In some figures, although the contractors are mentioned as an external entity, a ""lane"" is not used to represent them and thus observe the interaction with the process in review.  The future work presented is related to the results obtained from the improvements implemented from the analysis carried out in this work. I believe that more than following the improvements implemented, it is appropriate to follow up the way in which the review of a process is approached in an environment that does not prioritize these types of tasks or is complex to perform them."
195,90,"The article complies with the requirement to present a business experience in ICT applications with an emphasis on mining, therefore the evaluation will not be made taking into consideration any innovative proposal in a scientific article.  This article describes a successful experience in using BPMN to model the business process of the Engineering and Projects area of a Peruvian mining company. A simple small set of BPMN elements was used to model the business process. This experience is valid, but it is an ad hoc solution for the chosen business process. The solution would have a higher value if a small model had been presented that could be validated and could solve a certain set of business processes associated with mining.  Some observations and/or minor comments:-Does not meet the requirement to present articles as anonymous authors and institution. -In Summary, change ""control their processes"" by ""control of their processes"". -In Introduction, change ""BPMNs benefits"" for ""BPMN benefits"". -On page 3 and others, use the words ""figure"" and ""Figure"" in the text. -On page 5, change ""Figure 2 has been included"" by ""In Figure 2 have been included"". -The reference to some figures 3 and 4 (shown on page 6) are only mentioned at the end of page 7.

The results are not concrete, there is no experimentation or analysis of results that support what was stated in the conclusions section. The conclusions point does not relate to what is said in the summary not expressed in the introduction as the objective of the work. Despite being an interesting study regarding standards and technologies such as e-learning or t-learning, the authors fail to describe the methodology of work, processes, experimentation, results and evaluation of the results. In the Results section (at the end) they speak of tests on devices but no such tests are described, there is no evidence of such evidence in the document.  On the other hand, the text has important shortcomings such as the following: 1. Both the Abstract and the Abstract have difficult ideas to understand or are poorly elaborated. 2. Spell errors are detected in the document. 3. What is said in the Introduction coincides little with what is said in the Summary. 4. Use of acronyms (abbreviations) not described in the document (such as ETSI), there is no glossary of terms. 5.

Apparently it would have been presented in another congress, with very small variations and that it would be good to highlight and specify those similarities and/or differences.  The wording and use of references is correct."
198,91,"Background Problems: The authors present the results of a cross-platform interoperability project, define the standards for content creation, however, the arguments used to select the model lack validation.  At least two or more platforms would be expected to be validated before defining and concluding that the proposed selection is the best selection.  The survey applied to 50 people does not describe on which platforms it was carried out and what kind of target audience.   Form Problems:-Words without tilde: last, valid, module. -Start of uppercase phrases. -The margin in the table is not respected. -The titles of the figures are found on different pages. -The enumeration of the devices is confusing and flat."
199,91,"It seems to me an interesting article that could focus more on the development of an application on Kurogo (an attractive product described in the article) than in the study of the ubiquity of technologies for their interoperability.  At this point I have several doubts, since the study concludes the following interoperability configuration: ""DVB-2T as the international standard of transmission of TVDi chosen by Colombia, MHP as the middleware for TVDi, MPEG as the format of encoding and decoding of audio and video of the contents and SCORM as optimal standard for the generation of contents.""  Does this mean that the studies should have been used by digital tv??? And, as far as I understand, a ""logitech revenue"" was used which makes the tv a way out of an internet connection, so it would be the same as comparisons about a common PC. Am I right?  With this doubt, it still seems to me that the article may be interesting to consider (weak accept) and clarify the concepts in the presentation of it."
200,92,"1. The article is very poorly written. For example, as the introduction might indicate the following. "" Given that SMEs generate approximately 80% of the employment in Chile and given that the tax burden concentrates tb. About 50% of the "" Why do you use abbreviations in the introduction?  2. The proposal has no development that shows clear results.  3. Why does it indicate references and bibliography? What is the difference? The following bibliographic references are ""naive"" ""According to historical data, the monthly billing of the product is 80% gas of 15 kilos, 15% 5 kg and 5% gas of 45 kg.""  ""Industry Prime contractor supplier from the industrial sector, the, plus 12 people"" Sincerely it is better to write again the article and improve everything."
201,92,"In my opinion, being the very high level proposal, you cannot appreciate its degree of relevance and usefulness.  In some passages the wording makes it difficult to read. This occurs throughout the entire document.  It presents a review of data warehouse concepts and very basic data mining, which is not based on a review of relevant literature.  It lacks concrete elements that can be used to develop a solution to a particular problem.  The bibliography, as presented, is outside of any norm used in scientific articles.  It is suggested either to refocus the study on something more concrete, or to provide evidence to better assess the proposal."
202,92,"The article describes the concepts of data warehouse and data mining, then raises a few steps to describe a simple stock replenishment process for a case of a liquefied gas distribution company. He only stays in the speech and does not raise something concrete. It is not a job that generates a scientific contribution and is not relevant to the congress"
203,93,"While this article lets you see a good amount of work, it's written cryptically and it's very hard to see where it points.  There are drafting problems in: Summary (1): ""lack of keys and relationships between tables and data, and instead performance"" Phase 2 (8) is generated: "" At this point the database mounts were performed on the two (2) SGBD NoSQL in the cloud. And the mobile database manager system that is going to be in communication with those mounted in the cloud was mounted. ""  Behaviour ... (9): ""For MongoDB's case, there is an ODBC developed by students that is being developed by students, and another ODBC developed by Simba Technologies"" The article, in any case it is very difficult to follow ...  Understanding: The title speaks of a comparison ... yet you never see such a comparison.  ""they handle the CAP theorem ..."" the theorem says that there are three characteristics that cannot be given simultaneously, so they ""handle"" does not make sense.  ""de-normalizing data, that is, the ACID properties (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability) are sacrificed by performance issue ..."", I do not see a direct relationship between de-normalizing (a design aspect) with acid properties (a set of transaction properties).  It is said at one point ""Two systems were chosen from cloud-hosted NoSQL databases that are MongoDB and CouchDB; databases from which transactionality tests are done with the mobile database manager Ultralite,"" finally you never see these tests or their results.  It says ""however the ODBC solutions are no longer so popular ..."" What does this support???  Finally, there is talk of the use of a ""Sybase Mobilink"" middleware, however, later there is talk of problems with an odbc for the noSQL sabd (which would require Mobilink) ... and ultralite and the comparison is not known what happened ... ????"
204,93,"The article describes very well the SGBD for mobile, as well as some BD engines with non-relational technology known as NoSQL, in a context of cloud data storage or cloud-computing. Performs a good comparison of the technical characteristics of some BD managers in this field (table 3). It proposes a methodology, apparently to define and perform an experiment that allows to evaluate and compare BD of this type, as defined in the title of the article. However, it only comes to establish a simple and qualitative comparison of components and other aspects as services (Table 4). There is no evidence of a quantitative and objective comparison, at the level of performance and with data, transactions, and processing times that actually allow to sustain, as it does without these variables, which BD is more efficient with respect to another. The summary is not contained or identifies the full work. The conclusions are based on the characteristics and not on comparative performance tests. In short, it is a work from the point of view that would be a contribution if it formalized the methodology and described the quantitative application of an experiment that really allows the SGBD to be compared in a cloud-computing context. It is suggested to complement with a controlled experiment with data and recording of test transactions and to measure variables, obtain objective statistics that allow to evaluate the performances of the systems of mobile BD and NoSQL, under clearly defined conditions and parameters and in the same medium-environmental conditions (bandwidth, transactions, volume of data, equipment, etc)."
205,93,"The article presents a review of mobile and NoSQL SGBDs.  However, the work is more descriptive and lacks experimental results.  What it points out on page 8, methodology, considers two phases, of which only the results of the first phase appear.  It is suggested to perform the second phase, which involves an experimental data collection work and its analysis, and then generate an article with these results."
206,94,"The article describes a set of data extraction techniques mainly found in ETL tools, mentions the social networks that in principle points out as data sources for a study, but which definitely does not apply or at least does not show its application and results, the same goes for the NoSQL databases that it mentions but which is observed and describes a job with them.  While it's true that this is a review, more seems like a teaching material to impart an introductory class of ETL. I would suggest taking advantage of this preliminary review to propose a work methodology in social networks, in addition to establishing the steps to follow in this methodology for an efficient extraction of data from the social network repositories pointed out, perhaps comparing the performance and usefulness of the techniques in each social network and evaluating which ETL techniques are most appropriate but empirically.  It should also be noted that it has some drafting errors, repetition of articles and words."
207,94,"The article does not fully reflect what is indicated in the title ""Review of information extraction techniques in social networks on NoSQL databases"", since it is only a general look at the social networks and the data persistence systems they use (based on noSQL sabd). More than extraction techniques, the known ETL process used in Datawarehouse is reviewed, proposing its use on social networks. The main contribution is a proposal of six steps for the extraction of information from social networks, which focus on known topics, obviating the main problems that this involves, among which is access to data.  Wording (page numbering): (page 2) ""of the world of data"" (page 5) ""which are free of charge for the main purpose of collecting users ' personal data"""
208,94,"The work is interesting. It was noted that considerable time was spent in the literature review of the subject. The contribution is that it allows to review the techniques of extracting information for non-SQL databases. Once the techniques are applied, new challenges can be found that can be ""seen"" only at the moment of implementation. On the other hand the risk is in how many researchers are working on the subject in different parts. This because it is a main line topic. What is implemented in this regard? Is it worth applying the techniques? A look at these aspects is important to not find any surprises in the implementation.  The work is well presented and it is clear.  There are some errors:-Page numbers are not correlated. After page 5 returns to page 3. -The diagram of Figure 2 indicates that "" selection of sources ""and"" processing: data quality ""are activities of"" 1. Determination of objectives. ' However in the wording they are associated with "" 2. Data Preparation "" What activity are 1 or 2 associated with?"
209,95,"General evaluation The work is interesting but it is poorly raised, important references are missing. It is suggested to review the references that are indicated and to extend the article by improving its quality in terms of the ""way"" to raise the comparative, in addition to showing more examples of the cases of study that give greater weight to the article, with this you will also be able to incorporate the future works that are many and currently nothing appears.  Format corrections The references are not in the format that the journal Ingenare asks, review format and modify.  Figure 1 is an equation and is out of the format that the journal Ingenare asks.  Content Corrections On page 3 is referenced to [8] which is a degree thesis, what kind of degree?. It would be better to reference a scientific article methodology and that would give more ""weight"" to the article. When talking about HL7/CDA a reference should be given for more information. It is not clear the use of PGFOUNDRY which is an extension of postgreSql, was it used with Mysql?. More benefit should have been taken from the use of PGFOUNDRY. In the design of the case study in Figure 5, there are serious errors in the relationships between the tables Consultation and Patient, among the tables Medicamento_Sintoma and Medicamento. It is not indicated in the article that the duration attribute is of type PERIOD, that is important. In the query examples there is an error in the SGBDT query, figure 7, because the period attribute is indicated and the attribute is duration. The conclusions are very evident and do not present future works that may be interesting to carry out. (There is potential and enough to do) important references are missing, such as: 1. A review of temporary database research and its use in GIS applications. International Journal of Geographical Information Systems. Volume 3, Issue 3, 1989. 2.

210,95,"The article presents a comparative work between the use of a classical relational SABD and a temporary SABD (temporary English translation seems inappropriate: temporal or time oriented seems more correct).  The example set out in the article is interesting and motivating, it is adequately supported and gives rise to the comparison, as indicated ""it is necessary to define a test scenario where there is a concrete application that can be evaluated with the implementation of the paradigms to compare"".  There are two aspects that the article is not clear about, and that they are weighed: 1) The temporary sabd technology: pgFoundry, is indicated to be an extension to PostgreSql. However, no more information is given ... looking for it seems like a closed project??? How did you work with this extension?  2) Table 3 should be the center of the article, however it is not described how many of the comparisons were made. Leaving this as a black box. What criteria were used in the comparisons? There are some clues in the conclusions, but there are unclear phrases such as: ""Greater data entry flexibility can be found in the SGBDR, as there are more types of sources to populate the databases."" What do you mean by this?"
211,95,"This article presents a comparison, based on a list of criteria, of two database approaches: relational vs. temporal.  The article in general has a logical order and is readable. However, the comparison presents at least two disadvantages: 1) a lot of information is missing from how the results of tables 3 and 4 were obtained. A sufficiently detailed description must exist before you can replicate the job.  2) The case study presented forms the basis of the comparison. A real comparison must be based on a variety of cases and domains, so that we can then conclude on a broader basis.  I suggest addressing these two aspects first to better support the results and conclusions."
212,96,"Summary: This paper describes an experience of using a ""graphic"" language in a school.  Evaluation: The topic of the work is interesting, however, a) the job description is weak and b) the results seem unrepeatable.  For example for a), the description does not show any image of how the language works (remember that it is a graphic language). An example of scratch is strongly recommended to introduce language.  For example for b), there is no clear description of the configuration of the experiments, the results that are to be measured and table to easily appreciate the obtained results.  Minor details: a) The beginning of the abstract is super complex to understand b) An excessive use of ""this is"" c) some misspellings as ""preunta"" d) Very long orations."
213,96,"Background:-The language to be used in the form of Scratch is mentioned in a very superficial way, perhaps it is not necessary or should be delved more into the subject. -The number of students on which the study was applied is very small to obtain conclusive results. -A comparison or study between the use of Scratch and Alice (mentioned in the work) would be desirable. -Concluding from the experiment that Scratch is an appropriate tool for education in Chile, not including results with other languages is a bit rushed. -It would be desirable to mention that institutions or works related to languages to promote logical thinking have been carried out in Chile. None are mentioned as a reference or in the bibliography. -The exercise used in the experiment is only one, should be used more if it is objectively desired to evaluate its use as a language to improve the logical reasoning. -The first date comes from a Colombian news portal and from 2006. A stronger and more local reference, perhaps associated with the guidelines and curricula of the Ministry of Education, would be desirable.   Form:-The abstract must be rewritten: it has many words separated by commas and the wording includes ideas disconnected from each other. -The date 7/8 is quoted 8 times. With half of them the reference is clear. -"".. but few learn to program .."" should be: "".. but few apprehensions to program .."".-Quote 2 says .. ""Fundamentals of POgramation"" .. should be: "" .. Fundamentals of Programming ""."
214,96,"The article presents an interesting development of a case, as a further proposal of the starting methodology for the didactic of the programming logic. The conclusions presented are not very well founded in terms of the achievement of the objective of inducing logical reasoning in this way."
215,97,"The authors make a comparative analysis of various technologies for industrial automation. The analysis seemed to me to be reasonably deep and wide, but I termed it as ""weak accept"" for not having strong scientific contributions.  The text needs to be revised, there are long phrases (for example the second of the second paragraph of the introduction has 11 lines) and scores missing or placed incorrectly. The first sentence of the second paragraph of the introduction.  Also include the meaning of the acronym PLC and PC."
216,97,"This paper offers a comparative analysis of the use of wired technology and programmed technology.  The scope of ""related work"" presented in the document is non-existent. In this context, it is not possible to determine whether the comparison criteria suggested in the work are, in fact, relevant for an assessment.  The criteria for the comparison of technologies are in some cases objective and in other cases subjective. In this sense, the work does not suggest how to deal with the assessment of each criterion to finally make a comparison (for example, in the item ""security"" or in the item ""programming"").  There are grammatical problems (e.g., ""high time""). Additionally, the work is poorly ordered, making it difficult to understand by the low effort in locating the contents of the tables in a readable way.  A real contribution of this job is not displayed. On numerous occasions the ""Rexroth Bosch Group"" is quoted, without adding much more at each point. The impact and relevance of this work, in terms of novelty, is not observable."
217,97,"The subject of automation is of interest, in this article it has a very general approach, it would be interesting for example to refer to the compact PLC vs. modular PLC, besides it could be incorporated in the comparison to the microcontrollers of high end, since by providing them of a stage of power they can achieve very interesting results of application at low cost. The title tends to confuse given that the presentation of the latest technologies used in industrial automation is expected and rather focuses first on a historical review of the area's advances to then devote itself to comparing only two of the types of controllers existing in the industry. The exposed content is frequently found in the literature concerning the area, so it does not represent my opinion as a relevant contribution to the subject."
218,98,"The article presents an application of pattern recognition techniques to the classification of wood types based on audio records.  In the aspects of form: The article presents several problems of Spanish language syntax, which are easily subsable. The summary should be reviewed and improved.  There are also some English language terms that should be replaced by their Spanish meaning (e.g. test).  Equations 4 and 5 contain errors and should be better explained. Also adjust the font size (font size).  Table 1 contains redundant information, as the amounts presented appear to be independent of the method.  Improve the resolution and increase the size of Figure 5 (which occupies the 2 columns), since it is not possible to appreciate the different points and clusters that are discussed.  In the background: The revision of the state of the art is weak, with more relevant current references related to the recognition of patterns based on audio data (although not necessarily in the domain of the woods).  The version of the KNN algorithm whose pseudo code is shown is incorrect. It should be reviewed and corrected. It is not appreciated that I worked for a given K. Nor is the recursion appreciated.  Further information and detail of the data and derived characteristics is required."
219,98,"The work presents an algorithmic method for the classification of wood quality related to electricity poles and railway track. This work is interesting, but its wording does not allow for a smooth and clear reading.   The ones that should improve the article is:-Improve the wording of the summary. The summary indicates a test to test the hypothesis, but does not indicate what the hypothesis is.  -Remove assertions without references, such as: 'Defects that occur ... significant frequency'-An assertion is made that is ambiguous with respect to the work: 'the audio signals of the wood present the difficulty of not having well defined information ...' and ' ... with the hammer blow it can be more or less complicated to determine if ... '. So how did they get the features?, are these features reliable?  -There are contradictory phrases, such as: '... to make a data capture with the maximum possible interference, ...' and '' so that there is no interference ... '-There are many poorly translated words that do not allow a fluid reading, such as: urban and rural power, collected, I can, adiados, to follow, quantity, I tend, to do part, etc.  -Other words that must translate correctly: do, e, lo, Ajora,-The equations must conform to the format (example, 4 and 5). the titles are run."
220,98,"The work presents nothing new or contributes to the state of art. The sorting methods you use are very basic, there are many more effective techniques.  The popular and better techniques in the literature are also not discussed.  There are no clear assumptions.  What is being tried to ""prove"" in the experiments? The contribution is not appreciated.  Problems of organization of paper The work is very focused to describe ""functionalities"" of a system, and not the actual contribution in comparison to the state of the art."
221,99,"The work addresses the problem of autonomous navigation of mobile robots by defining a reactive control architecture.  The authors should be clearer in indicating why to use a reactive architecture, in relation to other available approaches.  It is necessary to improve the readability of the equations.  The work is correct and relevant. The scope of mobile robotics has multiple applications.  Some guidelines on future work need to be incorporated."
222,99,"The article presents a case of application of an architecture for the control of mobile robots. First the advantages of the behavior-based approach are exposed and then an application case for wall tracking-obstacle avoidance in a robot.  The article is well written, but the case description or experiment can be improved. It would be desirable to set the objectives for observation beforehand. The variables used could be presented in a chart.  While an improvement is mentioned from the inclusion of the diffuse logic module, the impact of this on the measures could be further discussed. The results section can be improved with a more defined structure, treating error results separately, false reading by reflection, wall mapping in cells."
223,99,"Although the issue concerning the problem of the autonomous navigation of mobile robots is of interest, the work presented does not necessarily have to be. However, as the reader addresses the document in depth, it is possible to realize that the work presented is a contribution to the subject. From the title it is clear what the reader will find in the document, which is reinforced with a simple approach of the subject by the author facilitating the understanding of the work done. On the other hand, a prototype is presented whose implementation is possible to replicate in the laboratory by those who feel interested in the topic, which contributes to this work being considered as a possible reference in the educational field."
224,100,"I do not agree with what is written in the second paragraph of the introduction. A solution for a complete NP problem, for example the travelling cashier, can be programmed in a simple way ... the problem is that the response of the program can take a long time. To contornate this are sought heuristics or meta-heuristics that may not find the ideal answer but a good answer.  On page 3, note that Pa is not an element of A and if a subset of A or more precisely a subset of A-{a}. In that same paragraph it speaks of ""two types of constraints"" but the second is not explicitly placed. At the end of the paragraph it would be interesting to say that ""that is, ai belongs to Paj"". The sentence is very long: 16 lines!  It is not clear in figures 1 and 2 the restriction that ""the sum of the amount of resource type k used in the period t, Rk (t), should not exceed Rk"".  In the mathematical formulation of the RCPSP it is not clear what it would mean, for example, that Fj takes the value 5 and the meaning of pj and A (t).  There was a statistical comparison of how good the quality of the solution found with the proposed algorithm of other solutions is, or at least a comparison that shows how distant the solution found from the ideal is.  References appear to have no logical order (alphabetic or subpoena order)."
225,100,"The work is TOO preliminary: there are no experiments and therefore no results or analysis.  The job only focuses on performing a discussion of optimization methods for the problem in question. Subsequently, it only defines known and generic formalisms for the problem.   The paper is VERY weak, it still requires MUCH work to be a manuscript with some relevance!"
226,100,"The work presents an approximation for the programming of projects using a bee colony algorithm. The work, even though it has a good wording, is lacking in the application of the algorithm, it does not present an example or several of application.  It shows the methodology, it defines the problem well, but it does not show an example of an application of the algorithm. Figure 2 shows a possible solution to an example raised, but does not indicate whether it is through the proposed algorithm or another method.  The contribution of the research, and the results, is not clear."
227,101,"The job is technically well prepared. Its structure and wording facilitates its follow-up. However, I have doubts about your scientific contribution since it is the application of modeling to a case study. It is not clear what the problem is to solve. The aspects oriented to aspects have already been successfully applied and no information is given on previous work to attack the gap. I think you need to distinguish why it is necessary to apply UML (and not other techniques) to solve it."
228,101,"The article proposes the application of UML-Oriented UML Class Diagrams to JPI Aspects. Overall, the article is well-raised and there are no big observations. What's more, a concern is being observed for making a good presentation of the job. I would just make a few minor suggestions, especially with the methodological aspects that should be a little more detailed."
229,101,"The article complies with the established format and has updated bibliographic references.  It is not clearly explained what JPI is, the objective of the article is not clear. The article is a description of the application of the JPI concept, which is not well developed, it is not clear whether the authors are who propose this new strategy or are applying a proposal from other researchers. The wording can be improved. It is suggested to extend the article to explain clearly all the concepts, scope and objectives of the research."
230,101,"• I recommend a change in the structure of the article for a better understanding of the authors ' contributions: (1) add a section highlighting the elements that are added in the UML JPI diagrams, (2) adding a section in which the comparison is included between diagrams, highlighting their differences and ending with a comparative table and the advantages that it offers • Summary • When they appear for the first time, you must include their meaning • Abstract • Review the wording of the abstract phrases such as: or Permitts modularizong -- > allows modularizing or Modules for crosscutting concerns or aspect -- > cross-cutting concerns or aspects modules or Try -- > tries or Case study classic of AOSD -- > classic AOSD case study • Introduction oReview number congruence for example:-To achieve that end, this work presents and applies ... and verifies hegemony ...-Avoid words like: then ... later • Theoretical analysis last paragraph page 3, very long sentences, not understood the paragraph-redo the paragraph.  • Case study or last paragraph page 3, very long sentences, the paragraph is not understood-redo the paragraph.   o Review well when using the concept of ""case study"", review the option to change the title of the section oReview the last paragraph of the first column represents ""a classic to exemplify the use of POA"".  • Conclusions: • End of first paragraph: interfaces -- > interface"
231,102,"The article describes the concepts of data mining and the steps that a KDD process carries out in general, and the latter associates it with social networks and in particular Facebook presenting them as an adaptation of their own, which lacks foundation and logic. For example, it mentions social networks where users manifest likes, feelings, and other states, which are usually presented in text, and on the other hand, it does not point to the text processing to determine the frequency of words and thus to determine the topics of conversation of a group of users in the network. It also describes some techniques of data mining and mixes the mining of the web, perhaps trying to combine different mining methods that would be the most logical if you want to cover different aspects of social networks, that is text content should be used the process KDT and not KDD, for the management of associations or links mining of the structure of the web, etc. On page 9 he points out that he used the technique of iconic representation to visualize results, however there is no evidence of this experimentation in all the work. Finally in the conclusions it speaks of a developed guide which is not explicit in any part of the article. It should also be noted that it has some drafting errors, repetition of articles and words."
232,102,"It's a well-written article that gives an idea of how to use data mining techniques on social networks like Facebook. It's a current and intriguing topic. But I felt a lack of more concrete things, or a concrete implementation of one of the techniques mentioned applied to the facebook or another social network.  The phrase ""which can convert data whose storage is unnecessary."" on page 3 stop. Convert to what?"
233,102,"The article describes some general aspects of the data mining application to social networks.  The review of information is not complete and is far from being considered as the state of the art of the subject.  I suggest first to review journal articles indexed in the topic, to identify a specific research problem, where a contribution can be made to the subject, and to propose a research proposal."
234,103,"Corrections to article: ""Information management, a continuing challenge of technology"". General evaluation The work is interesting but some implementation is lacking, since in general it is a good revision to the existing literature. Reading the article gives the impression that something is missing (implementation). A scheme should have been put forward with the model being proposed and that would make it clearer the good intention of the research to be done in the future. The work currently is a review to the literature with the presentation of an intention of research. A better title would have been a review to the state of art in ......ABC or indicate proposal of model XYZ Corrections of Format Verify the order that asks Ingenare magazine, regarding the references."
235,103,"The article is very well written and read with ease, basically having features of a disclosure article.  We discuss aspects that are essentially focused on information recovery problems in the face of the exponential growth of data. The proposal made at the end of the article is interesting, although, from my point of view, the inclusion of the Big Data theme is given with a certain light and requires a more detailed analysis of what is described."
236,103,"The article addresses an issue of interest as is the handling of big data and its structure based on metadata for its processing in the era of the semantic web.  The article presents serious lexical and even semantic deficiencies. The translation of the title and the abstract in English have serious errors. In the semantic aspect, in the introduction they mention as a problem that relational databases do not have problems of adaptation. As a lexicon error, they write to an, rather than Even. Wrong way is used the term Apurpose, rather than on purpose. The conclusions do not allow a proposal to be focused. There is good use of bibliographic references."
237,105,"In its form, it has some problems, for example on page 5, in the description of the implemented laboratory, it is described, the proposed structure with six cameras to locate the robots in the field during a football game, pointing out that this is shown above and appears [9], where figure and reference exist. On the other hand, in the middle of the bibliographic references, figure 14 appears, which is not referenced in the document.  In its content, about 50% of the article is dedicated, to the analysis of techniques of position capture and movement by triangulation of images, which have been repeatedly dealt with in the technical literature and which does not provide value from the scientific point of view. It is only a bibliographic collection of vision techniques. On the other hand, the description of the results is not a contribution to the topic of the article that is the use of vision technique for the determination of robots dedicated to football.  Finally I think the author of the article was very unrigorous in writing it, where at least he should have reviewed it before sending it."
238,105,"Very good article to understand the spatial location of objects, for control purposes, in this case applicable to a robot set in a football game."
239,105,"I find it an interesting article to be considered, although the ultimate goal of it is somewhat obscure: ""measuring the robot position on a football field."" In particular, it is not clear whether the work is oriented towards a more ambitious later goal (multiple robots, real time equipment movement, and what to finally do with this data? ??).  So it can be deduced, although not explicitly stated, measurements were made of ""a"" robot ""locating it"" in different positions of the field, but not with it moving in real time. This results, which could have been obtained with another more classical configuration of the area of computational vision (the contribution of the robot and the football field, at least until now they have no fundamental relevance in the developed work).  Finally, it doesn't seem to me that the results obtained are strictly novel, but still it can be an attractive experience to be known."
240,106,The paper presents a survey of two miners on the architecture stage of the IT outsourcing process. The work is exploratory and therefore its contribution is reduced as no results are yet presented. I believe that in this state it is inadequate for the conference where the presentation of results and contributions to the research is expected. The document should be improved in terms of its wording.
241,106,"The name of the article is ""How it affects ...."", and indicates in its Summary ""... applied through a case study to two miners from the Antofagasta region and to a company of type supplier"". However, the article does not present a section with the indicated case study, which indicates that it is not possible to answer the question expressed in the title of the article. So, they are good intentions expressed, but there is no empirical evidence.  The subject is very important, the form of solution is also appropriate, but everything is expressed in theoretical terms. It is indicated that ""the investigation is currently in the stage of conducting interviews"", as expressed, no analysis of the data or results and conclusions has been carried out.  The Results section presents no results.  It is going to be an interesting article when all the stages of the proposed methodology are met.  Some minor observations and/or comments:-References [6] and [13] were not used in the text. -The first paragraph of the State of Art is a repetition of the second paragraph of the Introduction. -On page 3, change ""key activities"" for ""key activities"". -The Figure on page 6 has no title."
242,106,"The article presents an introduction to the investigation of the effect of the IT Outsourcing in the mining of the second region, but does not show concrete results. The same article states that the investigation is not complete. It would be interesting to have the full analysis of the results."
243,107,"The article has two main contributions: a discussion about the usefulness of SCADA controls on mobile devices, a description of some of the concrete applications that implement this function in cell phones or tablets.  There are several writing errors throughout the article. For example, separators are used at the end of phrase _, but not consistently. The abstract's first and final prayer seem poorly worded. In the final paragraphs of the introduction the lists are not clearly explained.  While it is relevant for the conference to do a review of SCADA applications for mobile, a search mechanism is not defined, nor a criterion for comparing them. What are their differences? What is appropriate in each case?  It is suggested to include a comparative table of their benefits, and more importantly, to define comparison criteria in order to provide new data to the reader. The conclusions take the introduction but do not answer which applications should be used for the mining industry context."
244,107,"The article presents a theoretical analysis on SCADA systems.  There is no evidence on the app in a case study.  The Summary is not adequate, nor is the introduction.  The Results section and the Conclusions section do not present contributions for a scientific article or show business experiences in ICT applications.  References [3], [5] and [7] are the same author, same title and same date. The same goes for References [4] and [6].  The Reference [1] is not used in the text."
245,107,"The application of SCADA systems for mining is interesting, but the work is limited to mentioning the mobile tools and there is no clear comparison between them. The specific contribution of these tools in a real mining process is also unclear.  There are consistency issues in the summary and introduction. The conclusions are not convincing enough, and there are some drafting problems."
246,108,"the work presents a state of the art with respect to the networks of underwater sensors UWSN and the underwater autonomous mobile robotics. In particular he describes the problematic presented, delivering topologies, strategies and hardware for communication.  The text is very descriptive, unanalytical and critical, generating little input and value, beyond a bibliographic collection."
247,108,"The work consists of a survey type article or study of the thematic on networks and sub-aquatic vehicles, bibliographic review and related technology very interesting and complete in my opinion. I suggest that I could deliver a contribution based on this study, for example by providing a taxonomy of the characteristics of the technologies required for this type of problem-solving pair, and adding a proposal through an implementation and testing methodology. The above points to it as delivery in future work, perhaps at least it should have delivered a comparative table of the associated and described technologies."
248,108,"It's a good job, well written, it treats a new topic in the network of aquatic sensors, it will report the tests more in detail and the effectiveness in the application."
249,109,"The article presents an experiment that compares different navigation architectures for a mobile robot. The architectures (algorithms, approaches) used, as well as the metrics defined to evaluate performance in navigation are described. The results are analyzed statistically using variance analysis.  The article is well written and the experiment is presented in clear form. The bibliographic references appear to be appropriate. In the introduction, the comparison objectives are correctly justified and the possible approaches to the navigation of a robot are described in general.  The selection of metrics is justified and attempts to go beyond a combination of simple measurements. The experiment is well described, although it could be explained why other obstacle configurations were not included in the observation. Statistical methods (analysis of variance) are applied correctly, although an analysis of normality in the distribution could be included.  One of the weak points of the work is that a deeper discussion of the results is needed. Beyond indicating that one of the architectures has better performance, the reasons should be discussed and further conjecture should be made.  The generalization of the results and the discussion of threats to validity should be part of the discussion. For example: In what kind of obstacles does each algorithm improve? What is the programming effort of each of the architectures? What are the robot's high-level navigation goals (deliberative behavior)?"
250,109,"It is undeniable the interest that causes the problem of the navigation of robots, so that the work presented constitutes an alternative for the choice of the architecture of control, given that it presents us by the comparison of metrics a possible solution to the problem, however it must be taken into account that it has been realized in a simulation environment, under certain conditions that will not necessarily be replicated in practice which in my opinion restricts the scope of application of the obtained results. Moreover, the references and development of statistical calculations give validity to the results obtained with regard to the environment in which the test was carried out.  Well developed work, although there is a need to test with the real mobile, under various conditions of the robot environment, to validate the results obtained in the simulator."
251,109,"The work compares four autonomous navigation architectures for mobile robots, pure reactive architectures, neural networks, fuzzy logic, and a neuro-diffuse hybrid architecture.  The work is well presented, the experimental work seems replicable and the results presented sound coherent.  The main aspect to be improved would be the analisi/discussion of the results, which can be further developed."
252,110,"The article presents a research plan that proposes to combine the theoretical constructs of competences for the management of technology (with the BTM model) and the precept of professional success (with a proposed model that combines several factors of different sources).  IT management capability is a key element for area professionals and not just their technological competencies. It seems relevant to study how these competencies impact on professional success, or at least on the subjective precept of such success.  The study contains references to relevant sources, although it is suggested to reduce the number and prioritize for the case of articles in journals or congresses.  Although the topic is relevant, there are some risks in the definition of the constructs that are not analyzed. What are the limits between the perception of professional and personal success? Can we do a study of the perception of professional success only by considering the BTM model and leaving out the technological competencies? Does the study apply to all IT professionals or only those who manage technology projects such as CIOs?  The main weakness of the research is that it is identified as an experimental method, when in fact the survey does not have the degree of control over the object of study to be classified in this way. There is also talk of causation study, but the survey would only allow for a co-relationship study.  The survey explains the factors assessed and the Lickert scale. However, examples of concrete questions are missing and explain how they will be answered by the subjects. For example: Is it viable for a person to assess their commitment or leadership? Although the relationship is being assessed in general terms and not itself, a validation of the model should be carried out first and then the survey itself with a group of experts or managers of IT professionals."
253,110,"The article shows the design of an investigation into the impact of IT skills on the perception of professional success, but it is not what it points out in its title. A section corresponding to an extensive review of previous work and definitions is observed, compared to the section showing the design of the research, which is quite brief. In my opinion it was convenient to have presented the article as a systematic review on the existing literature of the subject in order to find gaps and/or similarities in the design of the research, or to have put more emphasis on the latter. While the subject may be novel, the article does not prove it, as it is only the presentation of a research design.  In the conclusions section, no concrete conclusions are drawn from the work done, only possible scenarios for future work.  With respect to form, the article is well structured, but details are observed to correct:-abuse of ""IT""-in some paragraphs previous works are indicated without being referenced-the figure of the model is very basic (not a contribution)-paragraphs not aligned (justified)-figure 1 should have been a table-error in the correlation of figures"
254,110,"This article aims to identify the incidence of IT business competencies in the perception of professional success. We present the problem, the analysis model, the hypothesis and the research methodology.  It is an interesting topic, but the author indicates that the research is in the data collection phase and that it is about 7 months to obtain the final results.  However, the theoretical analysis done is quite important.  Figure 3 is very simple. I suggest that the proposed model provides more information. To do this, you can join in a single figure Figures 3, 4 and 2. Use numerical references and references in APA format (you should only use numeric references and correctly).  There are 2 pages with page number 3.  In page 5, Figure 4 appears, in page 6 is shown Figure 2? Is there Figure 3?  In Reference [11] does not indicate the name of the conference, Reference [15] has no date, the Reference [30] is a book?, the Reference [34] has its title written entirely in capital letters, Reference [45] says only ""Fifth"", Reference [46] says ""Second"".  In Conclusions, change ""thesis q of"" by ""thesis of"". Change ""will be displayed"" by ""will be displayed"".  References [8] and [46] are not used in the text.  The name of the author and institution should be anonymous (according to the rules of the congress).  On page 5, you should check that the text is right-justified.  On page 8, change ""are capable"" by ""being able""."
255,111,"I find it an interesting job, with an emphasis on covering practical gaps. Their content and structure are technically well presented. On the other hand, however, there is no clear distinction between previous work and the original proposal of this work. The article states that there are previous works on this pairing CMMI-AGIL but does not indicate whether these proposals are sufficient or insufficient for improvement. That is, the motivation or justification of this work is not explicit."
256,111,"The article gives a general description of the CMMI model and agile methodologies, taking as particular cases Scrum and XP. A discussion is conducted on the combination of these approaches for process improvement, mapping the REQM and PPQA process areas with their equivalents in the agile methodologies.  The article performs correct general descriptions of the methodologies, but does not contain novel research elements that contribute to the knowledge in this area. For the technical/scientific community of software engineering it is evident that the approaches have different starting points, but they are combinable. This is especially true for software process improvement experts.  The review that is conducted on the investigation of the combination of agility and CMMI is not systematic. By state of art, you do not understand a simple description of each approach, but rather to gather the most up-to-date research on this subject.  While it may be interesting to map between process areas and agile practices, it does not explain what steps are going to be taken to do this. Neither is a validation of this mapping performed or explained how it can be applied, for example by a consultant in process improvement. No empirical evidence of the applicability or usefulness of the mapping is provided."
257,111,"The article presents a description of the integration between CMMI and agile methods of development. An emphasis that the authors make is that this integration is recommended for SMEs. The development of software for the smallest companies is an unresolved challenge. As such, the authors take a theme that is interesting and well-justified the idea of the subject. However, I think they fail to develop their point in the form that would be expected from a scientific point of view. Although the authors indicate that they do a review of the literature, it is not adequately achieved, since a methodology of systematic review of this goal is not observed. On the other hand, the article in my opinion makes an appropriate summary for people who do not belong to the area but are familiar with some key concepts described in the paper. It is worth mentioning that it seems to me a well-written article and, in general, with an easy to understand structure. In addition, another criticism that I would make is that while the ideas of CMMI and agile development seem to me well described, it does not happen the same in order to adequately justify their concrete application in SMEs. I think the article could be substantially improved. A suggestion that would make for this would be the presentation of a case that gives strength to the central argument of the article, that is, CMMI and agile development are compatible and especially useful for SMEs. Thus, less emphasis could be given to the review (which seems to me to be insufficient in this regard) and the practical relevance of the argument would be raised. If so, the article could have an interesting projection. In addition, the inclusion of references should be improved as there are a large number of arguments that deserve to be clarified if they belong to an opinion of the authors or are extracted from the existing theory. There are very small spelling and grammatical errors."

259,112,"Abstract: The article seeks to analyze the existing collaboration networks between Information Systems (SI) researchers in Chile and Latin America. The co-authories of research published in Contecsi and Infonor are used to carry out a social media analysis, explaining the latter. Three questions are asked, which are then answered in the analysis of the results through tables and graphs; concluding several similarities between communities and that there is collaboration among SI researchers, which is unfortunately mostly intra-institutional.  Evaluation: The work is well done. It presents a clear and concise structure that helps the reader understand the ideas being dealt with. It is an interesting work that belongs to a process that does not yet end due to the scarcity and continuity of data. The first caused by problems of records and normalization of papers published, and the second due to new versions of the congresses that will deliver new data.  Even so, some problems are identified, these are: 1) There is no argument based on data as to why these are the two chosen congresses, given that these congresses are small.  2) Being a work of a small scope (with respect to the used congresses), the usefulness of the result is also.  Minor comment: There is an error in page numbering."
260,112,"The work exposes clearly and with good arguments an analysis of the collaboration between different researchers and institutions. It is interesting the contribution made, first as identification of the opportunities for improvement in the joint work, and second, as analysis of the local publication.  It would be interesting to apply the same methodology on other congresses in the area, be it Chilean or Latin American and see the results obtained."
261,112,"Although the work is well structured and shows a suitable methodology, the usefulness of the study is not clear. The results obtained and presented are based on a very small study period, which removes confidence in the conclusions. Some small editing and editing errors are observed in the text. It is recommended to extend the input data set of the study."
262,113,"It seems to me an interesting job, mainly for providing empirical evidence on co-creation techniques. Their content and structure are technically well presented. However, the work has relevant omissions to assess its scientific contribution. For example, it does not present statistical analysis of the data thrown. It only exposes a distribution of the results without evidencing statistical significance. I also miss a section (or in the conclusions) about limitations to the validity of the experiment. I think it has several threats to validity that have not been dealt with. To name a few: it is not explained if the assignment to the groups was randomly; the time of the sessions is different; the learning in previous sessions, etc.  Other suggestions: p. 1 Title I think the title is not appropriate. It does not represent the core of the work that is an experiment. p. 4 Second column Errors in pag bullet format. 4 Third bullet second column each VEZ that has been paid. 5 Last bullet first column parenthesis"
263,113,"The article is about collaboration in creating content through social networks. The article is well structured and with some drafting details. The bibliography does not meet the format required by the congress.  With regard to the subject of the article, there was initially a doubt as to whether the article for the congress was relevant, since it was an experiment on the social behavior of individuals through social networks. Subsequently, when reviewing the experiment, it can be seen that the relevance is in the perspective of education in computer engineering. Therefore, I recommend that the article modify the summary by mentioning the scope of the experiment so that the reader, from the beginning, has more knowledge about the article. In addition, for more relevance to the congress, it is recommended to give greater emphasis on the collaboration for the development of some tasks of the discipline, such as the analysis and/or design of systems. Finally the article is novel in the way of how to perform some tasks through social networks."
264,113,"This article presents the results of an experiment where it is evident that co-creation techniques applied through social networks and making use of mobile devices can enhance the creativity of the participants. It is an interesting topic and I think it can be a contribution to the congress.  The form of presentation of the article should be improved.  Some observations and/or comments:-The first two paragraphs of the Introduction is almost the entirety of the Summary. -On page 4, change ""every one"" for ""every time"". -On page 5, Step 3, do not close parentheses on two occasions. -I suggest enlarge Figure 2. -I consider it excessive to use a page for a single figure. -In Reference [11], correct ""Conference on the, 2009""-Page number 3 is repeated three times. -After page 7, follow with page 3. -Reference [4] says ""2004b"""
265,114,"The paper has the following sections Introduction, Theoretical Analysis, Results, and Conclusions.  Paper is poorly structured. In the section Theoretical Analysis, basic concepts and methodological aspects are intermingled. The Results section of a case study that is nowhere to be defined. Subsequently, an analysis is carried out in terms of results on an experimental situation not described in detail that guarantees a minimum experimental replicability. Finally, the Thanking section is highly informal.  The wording does not follow the usual canon of papers (third person writing), but is presented in the first person. The order and presentation of each section are substantially improved.  In summary, the paper suggests the idea that the implementation of safety-instrumented systems is vital to improve the safety and quality of processes in the industry. However, no models, experiences, concrete empirical results or other equivalent are proposed. There are no real reasons for proposing the acceptance of this work."
266,114,"The paper presents an investigation focused on evaluating the impact of the instrumented security systems on the processes to which they apply.  The number of references is poor, considering the nature of the research. The use of references in the introductory section is particularly scarce. Also, the introduction does not make clear the contribution of research nor the methodology used, both things should be part of this section in a concise way.  The use of the first plural person should be avoided in the wording (e.g., 3rd paragraph of the ""theoretical analysis"" section).  Place the references within the paragraph, not outside (e.g., paragraph ""Security measures"", "" ... initiated. [7] "", should be"" ... initiated [7]. "" This is repeated in other parts of the document.  First paragraph writing error of 3era page.  Inconsistent reference format (second paragraph at ""Remainer risk accepted""). Also misusing score (1st paragraph of 4ta page).  On the results, these are not clear. The research question is poorly or ambiguously raised. On the basis of this, it is impossible to understand the input or approach. This added to the limited theoretical framework delivered, the relevance of the research presented is not justified.  The conclusions do not refer to any aspect of research or future work.  The format of the references must be reviewed.  For all the reasons set out above, the job does not have enough quality to be accepted."
267,115,"This article presents a ""state of the art"" in cooperative systems with multiple robots. From this perspective, it is an appropriately written disclosure article that from the bibliography point of view includes current references.  It is complex to carry out an evaluation of an article of this type for its contribution, although it would have been appropriate to provide some final by-product, such as a comparative table or some evaluation (areas of application?) based on the research work."
268,115,"The work presents a study of the state of the art as far as multi-robot cooperative robotics systems are concerned. The focus of the review is the control architecture present in those systems.  The abstract in English should be revised in its wording, especially the use of words, such as ""giving""-> ""providing"", ""panoramic""-> ""general"", etc.  The introduction does not provide a greater contribution to the structure of the document. There is a little talk about research associated with the subject, but with very low use in references and the section ends abruptly without explaining methodology or contributions of the work.  The work delivers a very unclear ""approach to the problem"" and does not provide greater relevance. Moreover, in addition to identifying some approaches to the context, the work does not propose any solution, alternative, categorization, framework or contribution in general to the (unclear) problem presented.  In short, the work performs a relatively adequate collection of information regarding multi-robot cooperative robotics systems, however, beyond that, a real contribution or relevance from the scientific point of view to the work is not revealed. If these points were clearer, if the methodology were to be presented directly, and if a specific research product were to be presented, this work could be accepted, but in its current state it is not recommended."
269,115,"It is a study of the state of the multi robot distributed control art. Unfortunately we are faced with the preliminary presence of the investigation, so its references are according to the advance. The problem is that the problem is not perceived to be solved specifically, if it manifests the future intention of a line of work, indicating open spaces to investigate.  There is a lack of preparation of the work; nemonics are used that are not defined previously.  You should avoid writing in first person.  The references are appropriate, but with little analysis, which could make the work more interesting."
270,116,"A very well written and interesting article. It would have been interesting to include the original and the proposed algorithms more rigorosa (step 1, step 2, etc.) as well as a statistical analysis of the quality of the responses of both.   Mention in the text Figure 4.  Improve the quality of figures 6 and 7.   In some parts it places equation (n), in other ec. (n) and in other equation (ec). (n) ... register for the first or second.  We also give the name of the authors in the bibliographic references, as some use initials, in another the full names and in other mixed ones."
271,116,"The work presents a method of detecting fractures in well images.  The work in general, is very unconvincing for several reasons: 1.-I invite MUCH space to describe the fundamentals but not to compare and/or discuss with the state of the art. There are many adaptive methods of image classification, and the problem presented has nothing different, except for a different application.  2.-The hypothesis is not clear, so the contribution of the work cannot be measured.  3.-The detection method described only defines mathematical formulas for the geometric characterization of the fractures. This is a fairly unrobust procedure and more so, the results evaluating the method are also not convincing in standard metrics used (accuracy, error, ROC curve, etc).  4.-The experimental methodology is very weak, does not compare the method with the state of the art, nor does it use standard metrics to analyze the accuracy/accuracy of the method."
272,116,"This work shows the proposed procedure for the automatic detection of fractures in wells. The methodology is innovative and interesting. The article shows the methodology well and has a good wording, but at the end of the article there is no better presentation of the results in real wells.  It is not clear the input of the article, first indicates that it is the automatic detection and elsewhere indicates that it is the modification to the algorithm.  It should improve the presentation of results in real wells and compare it with the desired and perhaps with the results of applying other techniques."
273,117,"The paper describes the current context of the use of available technologies to automatically control the dosage of macronutrients in crops treated without soil.  The work is relevant in its definition and development. However, the title induces an expectation that cannot be satisfied in the document. The paper offers a discussion on the state of art in technology for the problem addressed, however, it does not offer a comparative framework, selection criteria, or suggestion on good practices.  As the first approach to the research area is relevant, however, some more work of its own must be added to the paper."
274,117,"The article carries out an interesting bibliographic study on AI technology applied in the field of fertigation and nutrient dosing for crops without soil. It does not set or describe the design of a solution on a case study, and only stays in the preliminary study. So the title ""Design and Build an Automatic System ....""  It does not correspond, and it should be oriented to what it describes, that is to say something like: ""Analysis and study of the automatic systems ...""  It is an interesting survey type article but it contradicts with the title and the introduction, the conclusions are also not according to this type of work, should be more ad-hoc with comparative variables."
275,117,"The title of the work induces the reader to wait to meet the design and implementation of a system of control of irrigation, however as the reading of the document deepens this is increasingly distant, since the author proposes a review of various results of works carried out by third parties in a kind of collection of information concerning the subject, in order to finally raise from his point of view which of these results could be considered of interest depending on the type of crop.  It is necessary to modify the name of the article since it leads to confusion for the reader, since at the end of reviewing the document has not been obtained as a result of the design or less the construction of the irrigation system, only alternatives have been obtained to consider depending on several factors. Perhaps it is necessary to focus on a specific type of crop to carry out in detail the design and implementation of the irrigation system in order to carry out tests that validate the work done."
276,118,"The article describes an interesting application of control of a physical device (for the case under study, a mobile robot of Lego Mindstorms), by processing the signals derived from changes of facial and/or mental nature, coming from an Emotiv EEG helmet, which performs a high resolution electroencephalogram. However, despite the interesting nature of the work presented, the article lacks the rigor that characterizes the methodological process of research, a critical bibliographic discussion is not observed, there is no clear definition of the problem to be investigated, it presents a poor discussion of results and abundant errors of form (Ej. page 3 presents the following text "" Error! The origin of the reference is not found "", there is no page 2, etc.), which denote that the author was not rigorous in his review before the shipment. Finally in my opinion the work is a good contribution as an excellent project or workshop work within the curricular mesh of some computer or electronic career."
277,118,The paper corresponds to a very good application of a platform for gestural interface of actions with a robot. It is well written and with good use of references
278,119,"The paper offers a comparison regarding the application of algorithms for the removal of impulsive noises in two types of hardware architectures: GPU and CPU.  The document in general has a poor wording, especially from page 4 onwards.  The summary of the work is appropriate, however, its wording needs to be revised, e.g. the use of commas.  In the introduction, we talk about (i) image processing, in the middle (ii) you point out what is done in the present work and then you continue with (iii) a comparison between GPU and CPU. This structure is not suitable, it should be i-iii-ii, or simply move iii to the later sections and leave i-ii. Besides that, there is not much talk about the experimental design and the results obtained, things that should be included in the introduction.  Page 3 has a large white space to be fixed.  Section ' A. Phase of review "" does not have much value as an independent section, since it mentions something that is natural in a study of this type, which is the bibliographic review. It would be much better to join it with the next section (B).  the section ' D. Artifacts resulting from the project ""speak of"" research results "", but only aspects of the software are mentioned, but only a spreadsheet of results is mentioned, however results directly associated with the research are not observed.  Page 5 has another blank space.  In general, the presentation of results is poor. There is no table that clearly indicates the results and the graphs presented do not look good. The analysis of the results is adequate, but there is a lack of depth and relevance to what exactly we want to compare in both architectures. The images are not used or explained in the comparison.  In short, the work has good fate but requires a thorough corrective work to be adequate and scientifically acceptable."
279,119,"In practice, it performs a communication using a scheme of distribution of undeclared processes and data, in order to solve the problem of noise, it does not indicate the method of image processing, nor does the strategy used, it does an information handling by way of introduction to the CPU-GPU theme.  It is clearly a job that attacks a preliminary, simple image processing, where the method to paralyze and the strategy to be used for its parallelization in GPU or CPU-GPU must be shown.  From the image processing point of view it is a little original theme, but it is interesting that you start working on parallelism in CPU-GPU's, which is not new, but what is interesting are the parallelization strategies, the how to partition the processes and data, the how to use the grids, blocks and threads, how to put together a topology if possible, to give a solution that minimises the execution time.  Specify clearly what is an image processing job, filters that is used, method, and parallelization strategy."
280,119,"What is the contribution of the work?  The discussion of experiments and results is not very exhaustive.  What is the hypothesis of work?  The aim is not clear to compare as there are confusion between measuring aspects of ""efficiency"" (e.g. time) versus ""effectiveness"" (noise management and results obtained when processing images).  The organisation of work is a bit confusing.  In many parts, the work is more focused on describing ""systems"" and the ""application"" rather than the contribution and the model itself.  What does the proposed algorithm compare against??"
281,120,"This work describes in a practical way, a communication of how to introduce to the use of a particular robot, under a free testing environment, that works with this type of application. While it is well written, it only provides as a tutorial, rather than as a result of an investigation. It is noted that it is working very well, but it is a preliminary work.  The writing should be reviewed, because the abstract is very introductory, not indicating the relevant of what the work presents, also used nemonics of which are not described before. In the summary and keywords, nemonics are used that are not described in the text above. It has the particularity that it's a good job, but it's preliminary.  It does not present the architecture of the realized, images that account for the simulations, results achieved."
282,120,"The work describes the navigation of a mobile robot using ROS and the Raspberry PI hardware. The description falls into focus on configuration details, to the point of looking like an installation or commissioning manual. There is no report of results, less analysis of the proposed solution. Given the above, and as presented is not an article for conference. Only a report of how to use and configure the Raspberry PI."
283,121,Very interesting work as it incorporates an evaluation with users of the proposed prototype. It's well drafted and the results are clear.
284,121,"The authors present the work of the construction and evaluation of a visual tool to help the data mining process. The results of using the same on a user group and on a specific task are displayed.  Suggestions:-The conclusions mention the opportunity to build other support tools, however, they do not mention what they could be. -There is no mention of the reason to select WEKA as a base tool for the construction of the proposed software. -It should be added as an annex the detail of the experiment performed, indicating the model used, obtained results, etc.   Form:-The second paragraph of the introduction does not make clear what the intention of the introduction is, it should be redrafted. -Extensive use of acronyms, which confuse and hinder the reading of the work."
285,121,"The article proposes and evaluates an application developed to better represent the results of association rules algorithms. In general the article seems to me well written and structured. Perhaps, to improve, the structure of the document would add a special section dedicated to the methodology and describe it in more detail. The authors qualitatively evaluate the performance of the interface in terms of the ease of interpretation of the information that it delivers. To do this they expose the information to a group of users. The user assessment method is one known and validated. However, the article explains very superficially the process of validation of used users. On the other hand, the results of the evaluation presented are only descriptive. Statistical techniques of consensus measurement of interpreters such as the index of Kappa or others could have been used to analyze the quality of the match between the evaluators. In short, it seems to me a good article with a well-crafted but methodologically improved idea."
286,122,"The article seeks to summarize and review the filtering and segmentation algorithms of points in computer vision. In the words of the authors ""The objective of this work is to carry out a review of the state of the art in terms of the treatment of points clouds"". In my opinion it does not achieve this stated objective. My reasons are stated below. First, it is noteworthy that as an article that purporting to establish the state of art, it has a very limited bibliography (14 articles). In this sense, it would be more appropriate to indicate that this work is of a preliminary type (if it is so), since such a low number of revised articles would be justified. Second, and which seems to me to be of greater relevance, the work does not make an adequate summary of the bibliography, but rather it seems to be a point about some methods of filtering and segmentation. A review of the state of art, in my opinion, should have a purpose such as identifying the main gaps in literature or research opportunities. Third, although a literature review is, in essence, a summary, it must be systematic. That is, you must have a method that has to be specified. For example, what was the search equation used and what was the time range and selection criteria for the revised items or which ones were removed and why. Finally, although it does not have to do with the content or the objective of the article, there are obvious problems of format. For example, the whole section of conclusions is focused rather than justified. In addition, there are drafting problems which in some parts make it difficult to understand the text. For example, the first paragraph in the subsection ""Segmentation"" says, ""The process of generating a surface model from a point cloud, the segmentacorn that extracts the edges and partitions of the 3D world, the points play an important role in the lace of the surfaces."" There are also spelling errors like writing ""laser"" and ""laser"" on different parts of the document. In short, the article does not achieve its objective of being a review of the state of the art and, moreover, it has errors of obvious format."
287,122,"The article is a review of the state of art on 3D processing from a point cloud. To be a review of the state of art there are few articles related to the subject. A clear description of the point cloud processing for reconstruction is not provided. The applications are missing associated references, as there are many items related to surface reconstruction applications.  The article also has some formatting and drafting problems: paragraphs not adjusted to both sides, abbreviations that are not understood (PCL)"

289,123,"Summary: The work shows a model for measuring value and searching for its traceability. It is proposed to co-create value with the client as a method of creating value. In order to analyze the contribution of the co-creation the concept of traceability is introduced. He then explains a series of proposed variables to measure the value co-created under a conceptual model along with another model that allows the traceability of the various inputs through links. Finally, the results of the model are briefly outlined in a case.  Evaluation: Implementing co-creation types is very important for organizations today. It is interesting how the article mixes co-creation with traceability and proposes ways to measure it, presenting new tools for the organization.  Unfortunately the article has great weaknesses: 1) The scope may not be appropriate for a congress as INFONOR. 2) The results are brief and weakly exemplified, which makes it difficult to understand the use of the model.  3) More examples could be used to facilitate reading.  4) The paper format has problems.  Other comments: There are problems of drafting: a) ""Organizations engage with consumers to produce some concepts or initial ideas and use the consumers"" Abuse in the word consumer b) ""is valid the model of Systemic Archetypes"" small mistake, clearly ""the other"""
290,123,"The authors present a proposal for a tool for the measurement of value and traceability, however, due to the errors of form and wording, the contribution to the discipline is not clear.  The application of the proposed tool, but on the activities of the discipline, would be desirable.   Form:-The abstract is missing in English. -Table 1 is cut between pages. -The format has a lot of margin between the text and the edge of the page. -Figures are not correctly cited. -The introduction is VERY extensive, you can reduce the number of paragraphs and keep the clarity of the exposed. -The variables defined in the document: Expectations, Quality, etc. should be listed. -The enumeration of the chapters have different sources. -"".. is valid the model ..""?"
291,123,"The article is well structured, it respects the established format. Two proposals are presented associated with different stages of the process of value co-creation. Both proposals are presented in summary form. It is suggested to extend the presentation of each one more, and to exemplify them by applying them in some case study. Some stress and editing errors are observed in some parts (Ej. Results section, ""model valid ..."") A format problem is observed in the references. Some of the bibliographic references are very old."
292,124,"The article is a mere announcement of the research work that will be carried out at a later stage. The abstract of the theoretical framework, with only a few references and an insufficient study of the state of the art on the subject in question, is scarcely shown. There are therefore no results on the basis of which to establish judgments. The title of the article is not related to what is presented in the body of the report. It presents a lot of editorial errors, spelling and grammatical, illegible figures, reference to non-existent figures, title of a table in another column, etc."
293,124,"The work presents a research in development related to the cost of hiring IT services for the organizations, specifically a case study is proposed in the Mining Industry of Chile. The work is focused on a business case, however, although the paper emphasizes the theoretical collection of the concepts associated with the financial and cost aspects of the contracted IT services, the case study is not clear and the article seems incomplete. The structure of the document generates confusion because in the introduction there are set objectives associated with the case study but at the end of the document the results are not presented because the research is in development. It is suggested to narrow the article and structure it better, so that the preliminary results obtained up to the point where the research project is located can be presented, that is, a conceptual review of financial aspects for IT Services, without generating expectations against the development of statistics or analysis of costs that have not yet been calculated. To have a strong emphasis on concept review, the article has few references. It is recommended to improve the concepts and the conceptual basis based on a broad literature review that allows the research to be based and partial results of the revision of concepts. There are marked shortcomings in the drafting of the document. From the summary there are missing letters and the punctuation marks are not clear. In paragraphs like the first of the second column of page 3 it is difficult to understand the idea and that makes it difficult to read the document. In the definition of concepts such as IT Costs (p 3), it is necessary to reference the conceptual statements (fundamental basis of the article). It is recommended to take into account English terms, to unify the way of quoting terms or concepts. Some cannot be translated, but it is advisable to handle concepts in a single language. In addition, it is recommended to define the objective of the article and focus it to a single end. In other words, if the methodology for the design of the research is to be presented, emphasis should be placed on it. Or, if what you want is to emphasize the calculations established or designed by means of the tool then focus the article on this objective. As a general recommendation, it is suggested to focus the article on a conceptual review of Financial Costs of the hiring of IT Services in companies in Chile, taking into account that the research is in an early stage."
294,124,"General:-I recommend a change in the title of the article to really reflect the content of the article, since the title is ""Total Cost of Property for IT Services in the Mining Industry of the Second Region of Chile.""

295,125,"The work presents the design of AMADEUS, a platform that allows to implement mobile robot trajectories in semi-structured environments, for research of the associated algorithms.  The work in general is adequate, however it lacks something important: the comparison of the platform presented with other similar platforms. This is clearly reflected in the number of references. It would be appropriate to present references to other similar platforms, and to indicate the difference between AMADEUS and similar platforms, which would clearly show the contribution of the work.  Problems in drafting the summary (To carry out the defined movements ...). Also English must be reviewed.  The quality of the equations used must be improved.  The table on page 9 does not look good, this should be improved.  Section 10 is called ""results"", however what it shows are cases of study or application of the platform.  In short, the work is suitable to be accepted, however the state of the art regarding similar platforms should be improved."
296,125,"The work presents a feasible platform alternative to be considered in robotics for educational purposes, since depending on the level at which it is used, the study of the mobile can be focused on some of the areas that are involved, such as instrumentation (sensors and actuators) or in the programming (mobile navigation). Although the author does not refer in depth to the electronic aspect, the possibility of focusing also on the communication between the plates or on the control system of the engines, which already alone constitutes a problem of interest, is evident. In addition, it is possible to make improvements, perhaps incorporating sensors of various types that allow to capture more information about the environment. All this contributes to the fact that the Amadeus platform can be considered as a reference for the didactics of robotics and research.  Both the development of the topic and the conclusions presented are consistent with what is presented in the summary of the article, its use is highlighted in pre and post-grade courses, which strengthens its position as a didactic and research tool."
297,125,"The article describes the armed of a robot for undergraduate teaching, with the information of equations and control for its use.

Some comments of a general nature, which must be modified for final acceptance: 1.-By the characteristics of the communication, we understand the few references that it presents. 2.-The equations were copied and pasted, in most cases, they do not look very readable, so it is advisable to rewrite them with an editor of equations all. 3.-The figures do not present sources or references, where they were extracted. 4.-There are long paragraphs that can better accommodate a score.  In general it is a well-written job, it is easily understood its content, its presentation with the ""copy paste"" atentan."
298,126,"A very good article. I only suggest the following: The tables in the results section should be explained.  The tables contain only the smallest, largest, and average between those two values. It would be interesting to also consider the general average and standard deviation.  In tables 4, 5 and 6 only some lines contain a high value, the times the largest of the line and the smaller ones ... Better explain the meaning of these markups in all tables.  The reference [12] starts with ""and"" and not with the name of the first author (of echo it seems that the rest of the authors are also with problems).

Evaluation: The work has a structure of a paper and the proposal looks interesting. However,-Although the work discusses the consequences of the results, (I think) it does not clearly discuss the potential causes. Perhaps, interesting conclusions can be drawn as to why this divergence exists.  -It is not clear to me why we want to have absolute convergence on these techniques. To a simple view, it gives me the impression that a technical set applied to a certain context seems to be appropriate.  -Background is too short to introduce the concepts necessary to understand the proposal and Related work is extremely poor (there is only 1 quote) Minor details: 1) The name of section 2 ""background & ..."" is extremely ambiguous, which becomes difficult to know what the section is about. I suggest being more specific (e.g. ""systematic review for elicitation techniques""?) 2) No ""systematic mapping"" is explained, only its use is explained. 3) Why is there no talk of meta-analysis? Meta-analysis may seem to contribute to this discussion. 4) It would replace ""autors"" with ""we"" when amerite (e.g. paragraph 2-page 2). Sometimes it is difficult to know whether they speak of authors of a particular job or of the work they are presenting. 5) You would replace ""you"" with ""one"". ""You"" is informal. 6) ""The ** study** identified42 ** studies**""-> too much ""study""??? 7) ""Figure 3"" is separated from its image. 8) There is a blank page in the middle of the document. 9) ""In order to move in this direction, this study aims ausculating how researchers represent the approach of the techniques."" Which direction? It is ambiguous this prayer."
302,127,"The article presents a bibliographic review of requirements for requirements. This work emphasizes the classification of the techniques of elicitation from the area of knowledge of the revised bibliographic studies and from attributes such as Efficiency, Effectiveness, among others. However, it is important that authors improve certain aspects of the article that lower the quality of research that a job should have. For example: It is advisable to improve the quality of English. As the article presents, it becomes difficult to read and understand what is expressed.  The title is not very suitable for what is expressed in the introduction and the conclusions. It is recommended to consider a title modification that clearly indicates what was worked on in the document. The work is focused on analyzing the opinions and work done by different authors (literature review) with respect to the techniques of elicitation of requirements.  The work presents an important contribution establishing a classification from categories and domains, apparently identified by the authors. However, these categories and domains have been identified without indicating which authors propose such classification or, if they are the authors of the article, how (methodology or criteria) they were established to define the criteria and the domains."

Why is it designed under Relational methodology if what is sought is to model a Space Database that is based on Objects and also in this case PostGIS is object-oriented? Why not use an object-oriented design?

However, it is not possible to clearly associate the relationship between the concepts underlying the study with the analysis carried out later on the influence of the technology on security.  Additionally, there are aspects that should be deepened (e.g., Figure 4 shows a distribution at the level of use of operating systems, however, there are no greater details or implications that could have such distribution in terms of security).

316,131,"Contribution to discipline, value as reference, originality, clarity of content, etc. The present article offers a novel solution corresponding to an open multiagent architecture, divided into three sections: interaction, communication and semantic. The work is well written in general, except for some minor errors that are collected at the end of this document. The bibliography is acceptable, although it is considered that it should be updated to recent works-the last reference is from 2007, and there are works in the literature on more open architectures that have not been collected in this contribution. The article presents very extensive sections to the detriment of important sections such as results or benchmarks. In fact, it is substantially curious to observe how the design and testing part (section VIII) is not clearly worded nor can the added value of this contribution be observed. In the same way, section IX, Conclusions, should summarise these results more clearly. It also highlights section III, where the passenger transport systems are talked about with quite an extension, but then there is no other reference to this chapter or to this particular problem in the description section of the proposed architecture. For all of the above, I do not consider the work presented especially relevant.

317,131,"This very good job, just that it makes drafting errors, for example, the article in general has many long paragraphs and no punctuation. It is not in Ingenare format, there are repeated letter errors. It has the strength to be well-posed, with good references and makes a development proposal, which is a simulation. I found the testing section very short, so it takes credit to the job, you can also think that it's a good project start communication that is ad-porta to look for test scenarios either to simulate or apply in reality.  Errors: Page 1 in the summary is mentioned DARP, and does not indicate the meaning of the nemonic, which is mentioned in the keywords Missing the summary in English The fourth paragraph is very long without score Page 2 I find an error says Multiagent No reference figure 1 in the text, and not indicated the source Figure 2, not indicated the source Page 3 missing the translation of Scheduling Problem, could be The Problem of Planning Not defined MADARP, perhaps the subtitle should be MultiAgent ...

318,131,"The article describes an architecture proposal for open systems in the context of intelligent agents. It addresses the theoretical aspect of a certain type of agent in an appropriate manner, leaving out the type of agents recommended. The proposal is well described, detailed, and formalized, which shows an interesting work to be presented. The detail goes only on the side of the evaluation, perhaps very narrow and with little development, I consider that testing the architecture with a reduced number (50) requirements is very little to have an ad-hoc evaluation of its performance. In the form, there are small spelling details, punctuation and figure 1 is not referenced in the article. There are also titles in English such as II b and II a. Finally, the attention is drawn to the section of acknowledgments that is in English and gives to the understanding that the work is inserted in a project financed by Conicyt."
319,132,"SUMMARY: The work is presented and describes the application of a social network for news (4x4News), where the most relevant news will be present (among other features). This application is characterized by a split screen in a 16x16 matrix, where each cell is a news story.   OVERALL ASSESSMENT: The work is well written and follows a format (almost) completely suitable for INFONOR. The app sounds interesting and potentially useful as an add-on for already commonly used social networks (e.g. Facebook).  There are several independent points that I consider to be important to solve: 1) While it is an interesting engineering work, I cannot see what the contribution/contribution from the scientific point is. What can be re-used of this work for future scientific work?  2) Given that you offer an application, I think it is fundamental a link to (com) test this application.  3) In my opinion, the website http://terra.cl approaches what is proposed by this work. This is so, because terra allows user registration (profiles), comment news, rate news, and configure the website to show the news that a user wants.  4) This could be a minor detail, I think the use of social networks could be used for more than just showing the most important news (e.g. show a kind of tracking (social) of a similar news (s).  MINOR DETAILS:-At the end of the introduction, the use of BOLD is not recommended. -""The headlines don't perform a good analysis."" What is a ""good"" analysis? During the work, several adjectives used in an ambiguous manner are observed and are unnecessary (e.g. 'complex process' in section 2.1). -Within section 2: ""Development"", the related work is found (section 2.1). This section should be re-structured. -The quotes of type ""X, and others, ANO"" (e.g. Section 2.2 ""Wilson, and others, 2014""), I think they are incorrect. They should use ""et al."" -Section 2.2, is the coincidence of words enough to say that two news are similar? I think a deeper analsis is a necessary one. -To explain the concept ""bundles"" a little more. -The references are used numbers [1], but in the text do not use numbers. I recommend following the INFONOR format."
320,132,"Paper easy to read and well written.  It is in line with the work of INFONOR.  However, it is not clear how the ""Theory of relevance"" applies, it is too brief in this area of the article that in my opinion is the most important. So it is not possible to give a certain opinion about the work.  It is suggested to expand section 2.2, as regards how aspects to determine relevance are used or mixed to determine whether a ""news"" is relevant or not.  The tool elaborated is interesting as well as the elements used in its development."
321,133,"The article presents an application in the business sector oriented to the retail trade in the commercial company ""Caracol"" in Cuba. The subject of the work is primarily oriented to present and comment on the InfoCom application and how it eventually works in the company.  However in terms of its theoretical, methodological and analysis discussion of the results this article presents multiple shortcomings that are detailed below: The introduction of the article in general highlights the relevance of the application built for the company in particular but does not detail the innovative of this proposal and because this information system is better in terms of development or what are the characteristics that distinguish it from what currently exists in the market. Nor does the author clearly state the motivation that has led him to develop a new solution for the problem posed.  No research objective is defined as such from the article as it is mentioned that this will be the one to ""expose an adaptable commercial information system to any retail business ........"". In general we want to present the application built and it is not specified what is expected of the article, the methodologies to be used and the innovative in terms of development for the discipline of the information systems. One of the main limitations of this article is the state of art.   The literature review is almost non-existent in relation to the theories that support the development of the application and are not mentioned the main authors on topics of development of platforms of this nature. No theoretical framework is established in the article in terms of design or implementation of the application. Nor are any proposals discussed in these terms, so it is possible to say that there are no theoretical references in terms of analysis, design and implementation.  This difficulty makes the assessment of what has been developed only based on general opinions of what the concept of information systems is. The methodology of the investigation is another important lack of this article. The article moves between the importance of the application to a description of what is possible to do with it without establishing clear and accepted methodologies of development and implementation (neither for the design of the tool or for the analysis of the results obtained from its use). This complicates the assessment of the work as there are no research questions to answer, no ways to assess whether the author's expectations are met or whether the results obtained will be valid.  The author of the article should present and describe the research designs to be used to allow the evaluation of their validity.  Most of the article is in the development item and in it is defined and details the characteristics of the company in which the study will be developed. It is not clearly specified which parts of the systems are commercially acquired and which are developed internally and how the connection with other existing platforms is achieved. Neither process models nor data associated with this construct are set. The authors are limited to explaining the functionality of the tool and how it will be used in the company, but it is not possible to know how the results were implemented and compare that are highlighted as relevant to the implementation. Although the tool can be very simple from a point of view of its design and architecture, you would expect a description that presents process models using ad-hoc tools and at least a description of the design stage. The results obtained in general are mentioned as something that was achieved and as percentages of improvements in management and it is not possible to draw valid conclusions about them. The conclusion of the article is weak in terms of the results obtained from the design and implementation of the application and above all from the contribution of the study to the discipline of the information systems.  I believe that the article requires major changes and that the definition of the objective, the methodology to be used for the analysis and design of the platform, should be worked out.  I therefore suggest at this opportunity your rejection for this conference."
322,133,"The article presents a commercial information system adaptable to any retail business from facilitating data consolidation work and completing the automation of the import, distribution and provisioning process.  Despite good presentation and language, it is not a job that presents results of an investigation. Rather it is the summary of the development of a medium-complexity system. It also doesn't expose lessons learned or practices they could bring to other developers. In conclusion, its novelty and contribution to science is limited. Under these conditions, I believe that it cannot be accepted for the research track."
323,134,"This work is part of the area of the business architecture and proposes an interesting model of automation of business rules to improve the flexibility of the information systems applied to financial institutions. The proposed model is oriented to decouple the business logic from the business rules.  The problem addressed by the article is adequately supported by the difficulties mentioned in the field of software projects and in the financial world.  The author could delve a little deeper into the experiences of project development in other areas and the relevance of business rules in the development of efficient information systems in the company.  The objective stated by the author is to propose a methodology that will allow for the flexibility of the operation of the information systems in financial institutions, which in general is explicitly stated in an appropriate manner.  The literature review is relevant to the topics that are addressed and the theories and models considered are appropriate to the objective that has been proposed. The analysis associated with the concept of business rules and system architecture are tied to the theme. The author should specify how the relationship between process modeling and the design and characterization of business rules is established. It is mentioned that they use the decision point tables, but these are not mentioned in detail or visually. The author should better support the choice of ""Pipes and Filter"" as a model of system architecture. It would be important to also highlight if similar works exist in other fields (since the author does not mention it) The methodological aspect of the work focuses on describing the process through which the definition of the software architecture is reached to automate the business rules and tools that were used in its development. This methodological approach is appropriate and is clearly associated with a case study application. The important contribution in this aspect is the detailed description of the process from the lifting of the rules to the design and development of the proposed application architecture.  The author should make a summary table in which this process is represented in summary form.   It is clear that the results of this work have the desired validity, as it is based on the use of models and tools already validated in the field of the design of business platforms based on rules.  The contribution of the work is important as it systematizes a process that is of wide use in the development of information systems that are flexible and adaptable to the changing environment. However, these contributions are not clearly reflected in the conclusions, which is why the authors are suggested to improve the conclusions, including the significant contributions in methodological terms and the contribution to the discipline in which the article is framed.  The formal aspects of the work are satisfactory for the congress. There are minor details in the grammar as in the first paragraph of the introduction missing the letter U. It is suggested to accept the article with minor modifications"
324,134,"The article is titled ""Software Architecture for Automation of Business Rules at the Reception of Credit Requests in Financial Entities."" The summary indicates that the job aims to propose a business rule automation model that manages to decouple the business logic, however during the document no model is referenced. A methodology is presented in the section with its name, but it is not clear how this methodology allows to generate a business rules automation model. The article is missing a logical sequence of paragraphs that account for the explicit proposal cited in the summary. In the System Architecture section, the architecture of a system is presented and aspects of the architecture are explained. However, it is also not possible to identify a business rule automation model in that section.  Bearing in mind that the article lacks a strong job to improve the presentation of the article that allows us to understand the proposal that is being made, I suggest rejecting it.  Here are some observations that can be found to improve the work: Although the methodology used is explained in detail in phases, none of them refers to the results achieved in its implementation in the case of the work that is exposed, that is to say applied in an environment of financial institutions.  In the system architecture section, Figure 5 and Figure 6 are presented but are not explained or contextualized within the document. This creates confusion. This section does not identify the application of the methodology set out in the previous section, in relation to the generated architecture. It should be clearly stated how the architecture was achieved based on the methodology selected and explained in the Methodology section.  In the introduction that is clear what the proposal of the submitted work is. A paragraph should be structured where a definition of the objective is included in the work and the proposal for a solution taking into account the title of the work.  Some drafting errors should be corrected in how:-In the summary ...For which it is proposed ....? -In the introduction ... not of the main challenges of software engineering is to generate ...? -On page 3 the One term has a meaning for the business that must be understood and shared, it is repeated twice. -On page 4 the word valid, has an accent and in the last paragraph the accent is off the word is '. -At the end of page 5 the title is divided (widow). -It is suggested to improve the wording of the paragraph ... The architectural vulnerability of software systems has been observed in the provision of services in the services provided in respect of the libraries ... -Figures are not mentioned in the text, only the following figure is indicated, which constitutes problems both in the form and the editing of the article. The figures in the text must be quoted, with the corresponding number in the title of the figure. -Figure 3 is not understood. The text is very small and the business process model referred to in the preceding paragraph is not identified. -The last paragraph of page 6 is not understood and spoken in first person. The wording should be corrected. -In the methodology section, reference is made to a project that has not been described before. It would be useful to explain what the project is being referred to. In this paragraph, the type of methodology referred to is not clear. It can be dealt with a research methodology or an architecture development methodology."
325,135,"Throughout the article, the role of test automation within software testing and more generally in the assurance framework is exaggerated. A maturity model for the software test necessarily includes more aspects than automation. Automated cases will always coexist with manual cases and evaluations performed by people. As this treaty in the article, automation is too general a concept, it can encompass the generation, execution, evaluation (for example: mutation, coverage criteria) and validation (oracle problem).  Although the motivation is clearly expressed in the introduction, references are needed to substantiate the claims made about the role of the test and the impact of the automation on it. To say that automation allows testing faster or at a lower cost is simplistic: this depends on the context. The costs of generating automatic test cases, the estimate on the future evaluation of the software and the expiration of the test cases, along with other factors, must be taken into account in the cost model to determine the convenience of automating some of the test.  The section dedicated to the software test performs general definitions and traverses the history of the test from the mainframes. For a research paper, I suggest making more specific definitions related to the focus of the study (experimental studies on test techniques, automation, testing costs, maturity models).  It would be appropriate to put the development of the maturity model after presenting the related work. The process for obtaining the proposal of a maturity model for testing is not described.  The development of the model must be linked to other existing maturity models (e.g. the Testing Maturity Model) to establish connections with the accepted literature of testing or standards (e.g. ISO 29119) and in general with software process models.  The search string used is not explicit. Not all models found should be cataloged as 'maturity models'. Some of the included models are clearly more general models, which do not focus on the problem of test automation. We should at least discuss these differences.  The attributes used in Table III are not explained, nor is the way to obtain the maturity level results. What does 'level of published opinions' mean? This concept is ambiguous. The description of this research process should be reinforced as it is key to obtaining the 'adolescent' level result."
326,135,"The work is titled ""Current Maturity of Software Testing Automation Development."" The paper shows a series of paragraphs that account for a work done in terms of literature review and some approaches to a proposal to restructure a scale of particular maturity levels for the test automation process.  However, the work lacks a logical structure to determine whether its main contribution or objective is in the literature review or in the proposal of new levels of maturity for the testing process.  It is recommended to do a thorough review of the information presented and possibly re-structure the presented document. The report of this review was divided by sections, in order to provide suggestions for improving the work.   Section -Systematic Review It is important that the authors review the fact that they use a systematic review method that is not yet published and there are several methods published, tested and recognized for Software engineering. They should justify the selection of the method proposed by Serna M. identified with the number [16] at work.  It is essential to explain the validation that is made regarding the peer review of the articles, since it is not clear how access to a peer review of published articles can be accessed in order to validate them and in which way a validation process is carried out based on this information, taking into account the amount of revisions that would have to be done for each item found (978).  Test Automation While, at work, a proposed model is reported to assess the maturity of the software testing automation process. The model as such is not described. The article is limited to presenting a reference scale associated with the maturity of a human being. Therefore, it is essential that the article indicates several aspects to consider the structuring and definition of a model. Within the most important aspects to consider are: 1. A scientific and formal justification on which the authors of the work are based to propose the maturity model and the selection of the maturity levels of a human being as a point of comparison with a possible level of maturity of the process of test automation.  2. Formal Justification of why not use the CMMI model and the maturity levels structure that in it are proposed to evaluate the process of test automation. The above, considering that the maturity model defines an appropriate maturity scale for evaluating processes in software engineering. That is, why is it necessary to rethink these levels of maturity for the process of test automation and to propose a new scale based on the maturity of a human being?  3. At the research level how are the levels of maturity characterized in terms of test automation? Although, in the article, each level is characterized by indicating the possible characteristics in which the test automation process is present, it is not indicated how this characterization was determined, nor does it show a related formal and scientific justification.  Related work The work presents a systematic review, under which it is possible to identify work related to the area of study, in this case automation of tests or levels of maturity for the automation of tests. However, the authors present the systematic review apart from the related work section, when it seems that the studies selected as related work should be part of the analysis of the results of the systematic review.  In addition, the systematic review allows to determine gaps or niches of research (research opportunities) to determine a work area with some concrete problems and, from there, propose a possible solution to this problem. In this case, the article presents the systematic review as an additional and subsequent work to the proposal of maturity levels for the test automation process.  Likewise, the authors show the selection of some related works, it is understood that they are related to the automation of tests, however of the first Michael Grottke, they indicate precisely that it does not focus on the topic to be dealt with in the work that they present but in a statistical proposal of the automation of tests. Therefore I would not enter as related work.   Maturity of the software test automation development To perform a comparison of the test automation process and the maturity levels, the authors present Table 3. It indicates that in the first column the traditional stages of a test process are located. It is necessary to indicate under which methodology these stages are selected as traditional or to have a reference as justification for the selection of these and not other stages.  In this section there is no clear explanation of the determination of maturity levels at each stage. It is essential to have described the research analysis carried out that results in the definition of the level of maturity in which each of the stages of the test process is found. The table is not enough explanation for the analysis, as it only reports the results.  At this point, if what is sought is to propose a new scale of maturity for the test process or test automation, it is most convenient to validate the proposed scale with a case study. In this work, although the authors show a table where they seem to determine that the level of maturity is ""sore,"" it is not possible to understand in which context the process of test automation is being evaluated. It should, at least, be contextualized a case where it is indicated: region, time, type of projects or companies and methodology used to evaluate the process of test automation. The above is the basis for justifying that in a given context the process of test automation is at X level of maturity (of the proposed scale). They also argued that the criteria used to allocate this level of maturity were taken into account."
327,136,"The authors present an approach to solving project scheduling problems with limited resources (RCPSP) through an artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm.  The idea seems relevant to the problem faced. However, it is important to make the following improvements to the document:-Clearly establishing that the ABC application in RCPSP is something that has not been done before. If not, add a comparative analysis of the proposed solution to similar ones.  -The link http://www.om-db.wi.tum.de/psplib/datasm.html is broken. Replace with a link that is not.  -In the tables it is not clear what Makespan is. Is the duration of the ""canonical"" schedule for that problem? Is the duration of the theoretical schedule optimal? Is the duration of the schedule of the best algorithm for the problem? Is the duration obtained by the ABC-RCPSP algorithm? Explain this accurately-It would be advisable to have a brief quantitative description of the algorithm's performance in terms of time vs problem size."
328,136,"The work presented to Infonor-Chile, meets the following expectations: 1. It performs a successful bibliographic discussion 2. It incorporates a hybrid search hybrid algorithm 3. Results obtained with scheduling restrictions using the algorithm (limited resources) show encouraging results."
329,137,"The paper presents the proposal for a quality model for Internet banking software.  The work presents several weaknesses:-The objective of the work is not clearly specified, and is described differently in several sections. -The research methodology is not clear. -- > The constituent elements of the proposal (Dromey, ISO 25010, MOSCA ...). The motivation for why they were selected is not described. The bias that this selection can have in the model is not described. -- > The use of a research/action methodology is described, but the phenomenon that has been studied to consolidate the model is not described.  -- > The theoretical framework sections also appear to be biased, and the sources that gave rise to the selection of references are not described.  Other minor comments:-The translation of the abstract into English should be reviewed. -The software quality bibliographic, comes out of textbooks, and can be updated. -The scope towards quality tributes, is at the same time introduced as part of the methodological framework, and exposed as conclusions. It can't be both. In guiding the research towards owasp, the construct is oriented towards safety attributes, therefore the conclusion: ""In the same sense it is established that the quality of a system for Internet Banking should consider security as a mandatory point, in addition to functionality"" It is a result of the design of its research, and cannot be extracted from the work.  -Reference 6 and 11 is the same."
330,137,"The article takes a tour of quality definitions, software quality and quality models. Some models are first dealt with in a preliminary section and others after the theoretical analysis, I suggest re-organizing the presentation of concepts. In my opinion, the concepts of quality model and conceptual model are not equivalent, although they are dealt with jointly in the introduction.  In the second section several models are presented, but the relations between them are not clearly established and what is the criterion to take them into account in this line of research. There are multiple proposals for software quality models and web-specific models. On the other hand, OWASP guides are relevant to web application security, they are not a quality model.  I suggest setting out the theoretical analysis (which includes basic definitions of quality) before the description and justification of the models considered. On the other hand, specific quality concepts/attributes/models could be added in the context of banking systems.  In my opinion, devoting so much space to defining the concept of electronic banking, internet banking and then mobile banking, is not necessary in the current state of art and public knowledge of these concepts. I suggest focusing on the research objectives of this particular work.  The descriptions of the DESMET methodological framework and the research-action methodology are very brief. It is necessary to establish the objectives of the investigation.  The conceptual models obtained are the main result of the work. More readable notations should be used (I suggest also placing extended information as an annex to the article or on the web). It should also be explained how these models were validated, so that they are reliable if they are used to define ontologies or used in later works."
331,138,"The authors propose the analysis of the data through the CRISP-DM methodology, but in development it is not used the same.  The authors make use of the WEKA tool and the algorithm that this tool has implemented. Perhaps it would be better to think of an algorithm of its own for this type of data to be analyzed, or some mechanism where the expert does not have to mark the shapes of the eddies in the images to be processed."
332,138,"The article exposes the development of a pattern recognition case study to identify ocean swirls by satellite imagery.  The article is well written and structured. Your presentation follows a logical sequence of development.  In the state of art, methods are mentioned for the detection of ""eddies"". Except for the case of neural networks, no quantitative results obtained with each method are mentioned.  Therefore, it is not possible to establish a comparison of the obtained performance versus other methods referenced in the state of the art.  The understanding and exploration part of the data is weak."
333,139,"The article makes a reflection on the current state and possible projections of formal methods in software development.  Although the idea of such a reflection has an interesting potential, the article is short in two key aspects: 1. There are many assertions made in the document that do not have bibliographic citations that support them, nor do they detach from a logical deduction from previous premises. This significantly detracts from the validity of the arguments presented. 2. All the assertions presented in the document that, as interpreted, the authors want to present as their own, are in fact widely known problems in the area of formal methods.  In short, the article does not provide assertions with sufficient evidence or a solid argumentative line, nor does it provide original assertions.  For these reasons I consider that the article is not suitable for publication."
334,139,"According to the call, Infonor-Chile accepts reports of research papers on topics of interest in computing and information technologies and its applications; the article presents a reflection, from the point of view of the author (in some cases supported by bibliographic citations), on the challenges of the Forms of Formal Methods in the field of the Engineering of Software, however it does not offer supported contributions in some type of validation, more than the opinion of the author on the opportunities and challenges of that area; even the bibliographic review does not offer evidence of having used a formal process (e.g. systematic review) to support the proposed reflection.  It seems to me that as a work of ""disclosure"" it is very interesting, but as a report of ""research"" it is limited."

This makes it doubtful about the proposal. -The analysis of the quality of human-computer interface is not performed, at least it should include a usability survey. -The use of the PHP and MySQL language is mentioned as a database, however, no details are given of the implementation used (Patterns, SQL, ORM, etc). -Shows no evidence of application implementation: class diagram, database diagram, contracts, patterns used (DAO, Active Record, etc.).   Problems identified in the job:-The screen captures are not clear and they lose a lot of space when using as frame the interface of a tablet. -Figure 7 is over text, which is unreadable. -Figure 11 refers to the Google Maps application and the association with the application is not clear."
340,142,"the work presents a possible solution to a real problem, it is interesting the proposal of the veterinary SOS. At work there are important elements to be taken into account for the development of a mobile application, although in some parts of the text it is presented as a web development. At work he promises the development of the application. The article shows how greater profitability and better organizational management could be achieved in a Veterinary SOS, but there is no clear contribution to the implementation of such a system.  Figure 2 Process Diagram Level 0 of the Application must be improved, it is blurred. Figure 3 shows the description of the solution, but the information should be accompanied by information that takes account of the process in detail. You need to identify how to store and manage your data. The information will be stored in a BD? in XML? ..... files are missing a small description of the system architecture. The quality of figures 4 to 12 is not good, the texts are blurred.  The article should focus on the contribution and results of the application of this type of development.  Many development technologies and techniques are mentioned, but it is not evident in the development of the veterinary SOS."
341,143,"The article presents the development of a mobile application, does not include any research element associated with such development. It simply focuses on the application of the RUP process for development. The texts or articles used for definitions or assertions made, for example, on RUP "".... are focused on"" diagrams of use cases, and risk management and management of the architecture ""as such"" are not referenced.   If it's between cremiles, I guess it will be a textual copy of some part that is not indicated No in-depth analysis of the solution strategy is presented what is the logic behind the mobile app? Some problems are noted in the wording in the text, for example, ""... your goal is to ensure the production of high quality and high quality software ...."" The structure of the article has some deficiencies Figure 1 does not provide information to the work done, it is not necessary. Figure 2 is not well distinguished, it is also taken from the Larman UML book and the reference in the text does not appear. The conclusions of the work are extremely basic"
342,143,"It's a good application, which uses the development resources available for mobile technologies. The value you have is your clear presentation and explanation of the tools you use up to this instant. It is still in the development phase, because it has already quite exploited services, for example, it could assist the user in finding optimal routes to reach the parking lot or other feasible ones where there are already tools that can serve to provide other services. The novel is apparently the use in mobile technology for both IOS and Android operating systems.   You must correct the following: Page 1 Summary Usa paper to describe the job. It does not define mnemonics, example, GPS.  Page 1 Introduction No reference figure 1 and does not explain it Page 1 and 2 Previous works It does not analyze specialized literature and makes a comparative table of the applications .. this should be part of a comparative analysis of its application with the existing ones.

343,144,"Comments on the article. In a way: • Problems with the use of initial capital. • Disconformity? It would be better inconformity • Spelling problems. Some words are missing (for example: implantara), and they are left in other words (criteria). You do not have much presentation of these types of errors, taking into account that the word processors have spelling checker. • Articles in Spanish should always be written in third person. • Problems with the reference system.    Background: • Figures 1 and 2 do not contribute to the understanding of the problem and the solution. Please insert only figures that allow a better understanding of the need. • The order to present the information is confusing. First, the theory and preliminary work section should be dealt with in order to have the necessary background and to understand why the construction of a new application is necessary. • In the introduction always the last paragraph must account for the structure of the article. This is missing for the reader to have an overview of the paper. • In the section theory section they mention the definition of CRM, but apparently what they offer as a solution is not an application of this type. This generates confusion in reading. It also seems that they are mixing the definitions with the section where they compare other applications, or which does not favor the understanding of the article. • When you indicate the applications compared it is not clear what criteria were used for your selection. What was reviewed in terms of the specialized literature? • The quality of Figure 3 is not suitable for publication. • Figure 4 and its explanatory label are in different positions. This figure also has quality problems. • The way to show the proposed solution is very confusing. It is worth reorganizing the entire section to first explain the process proposed in the development and subsequently the results obtained. • Taking into account the objective of the article, a model section of indicators of the used extension robs space to more important aspects to deal like for example the usefulness of the application being mobile and has data as the location of the seller. • The title of the work does not suffer from the content. No emphasis was placed on the mobile component that was apparently the greatest goodness of the app. • The statistics section does not connect with the rest of the content, and no explanatory legends are used to achieve this connection."
344,144,"The article deals with a simple job of developing an application to generate management indicators for a company and presents no contribution from the scientific point of view.  It has problems adjusting to the requested format and presents many misspellings, punctuation and writing errors.  The title is not in line with its content, it does not describe anything about the mobile platform.  The bibliography is very vague, in some cases simple web addresses, in addition it does not conform to format."
345,145,"SUMMARY: This work presents/offers a mobile web application that allows, through a Geo-Localization of the device, to create a crime map in the city of Lima, Peru.   GENERAL ASSESSMENT: The document does not follow the structure of a scientific article and does not appear to follow the format of INFONOR either. In addition, the work presented seems more like an engineering work than a scientific one. Although this mobile web application might be interesting, it should be mentioned does not offer any URL where (com) test the presented application.  Section 2 should discuss related work and some concepts, but in the middle of this section, part of the proposal is described. In addition, the work defines in almost a column that is crime using extensive citations (""..."").  The discussion section of experiments and results are not described experiments or results (the latter are described but not discussed), only a few facets/screens of the application are shown. Also, it justifies the use of Android via a very long quote (""..."").   MINOR DETAILS:-The abstract in English can be upgradeable, starting with removing the first word from the paper. The abstract could be written in Spanish. -The format of the document does not follow the INFONOR standard, especially with the margins,-In some parts of the document, you can observe the word ""thesis"" and not article. In other parts of the text, the word ""ponence"" can be observed. -Figure 1 does not contribute in almost anything to the document. -After each title, it can be observed "":"" that is not necessary. -Section 2 uses excessive quotes ""...""-Section 2.2 talks about types of crime, but in the sub-titles of this section says ""Analysis""-The title of section 2.3 clashes with the text of the left column-Table 2, which mentions applications, is not evaluated."
346,145,"The article presents the development of a mobile application to make complaints, warn of a criminal act and create a map of the crime itself. The article requires better writing and improving its technical structure as an article of research. For example, it does not present the summary in Spanish.  Being a software application, your contribution to research is limited. I suggest running to track or business application workshop."
347,146,"The article presents a proposal for Inconsistencies Repair in Data Warehouses using restrictions that have semantic sense. Priority and safe restrictions are proposed, in addition to using previously defined heuristics in ""Repairing dimensions hierarchies under inconsistent reclassification"" for the computation of r-repairs.  The examples used to explain the proposal are clear. The article is well written."
348,146,"It is a difficult job to catalog, it presents a theme usually associated with deductive databases (repair), where there must be rules or restrictions of integrity that have been violated, adapted to the theme of inconsistency produced by new facts in a DW that do not fit correctly to its dimensions. This is normally dealt with in this area by using Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD), something that is strangely not named in the article.  Still, and assuming that the problem really exists and has applicability, it is presented very superficially, and eventually ends in an informal proposal that is not rigorously described as an algorithm itself. I think it is a proposal that is still in a very early stage and whose problems cannot be convinced as such."
349,147,"Review the wording of the document, in several places it says ""on the basis of"" it must be ""based on"" It is necessary to reference the source of figures 1 and 2. On page 8 the subtitle should be complete ""Smart Agents"" on the same page 8 tilde in consider on page 10 indicate that fuzzy logic is a ""degree of truth"" based approach really is in ""degrees of belonging"" In the conclusion (4) ... and International ...  The work is interesting, I consider that I could have condensed more the information of the first 3 pages, perhaps using a table summarizing all the considerations in the searches."

I would highly recommend: 1. use of color for better graphics understanding 2. mention names of authors or books, to not begin with references.  I miss a comparison table of efficiency, advantages, disadvantages and uses for all AI algorithms used."
351,148,"The article presents an approximation by Genetic Algorithms (AG) to solve light diffusion equations in murky media.  It is indicated that one of the main advantages of AG over traditional methods is the elimination of noise from the resulting images. However, it is not very clear what this is due to, nor is it clear that a quantitative method has been used to determine the absence of noise. It is imperative that the authors solve this problem to give sufficient solidity to the article."
352,148,"The paper shows an application study of Genetic Algorithms to solve a system of equations in optical imaging of tumor detection and follow-up of cancer treatments.  The work is well written and has a high level of technical detail. However, it does not explicitly show what their main contributions are. In this sense it would be appropriate to extend the Introduction Section to give the reader a detail of the main contributions of the work and also to include in this section (or in a related section of Work or State of the Art) a greater detail of other previous works that are related to the proposal of the authors.  In the field of application of Genetic Algorithms for the resolution of systems of equations, this work does not present a novel contribution, since there are several previous work oriented to this type of solution. With regard to image analysis and pattern recognition, there are previous works that already use Genetic Algorithms for these types of proposals, such as Dourdan, 2015.  It would be convenient to have had a comparison with other methods of Machine Learning that have been widely applied to the recognition of images such as k-means or PCA.  Minors:-Figure 10 does not display the series Solution AG well because of the number of points plotted. -Last paragraph of Conclusions. "" ... the advantage of working with heuristics as the genetic algorithm ... ""should be"" ... the advantage of working with heuristics as the genetic algorithms ...

The references to the work of Pattern Recognition is old 1997, I think there are more updated references and there are more jobs where different techniques of machine learning are applied for recognition of patterns, from supervised to unsupervised methods."
353,149,"This article describes the simulation results of the protein fold problem based on an amino acid sequence.  In general, the article presents several drafting and spelling problems (e.g., second paragraph, lines 4 and 8 of the summary). Also, very extensive paragraphs are usually used that make it difficult to follow the idea of the exposed (e.g., second introductory paragraph, artificial neural networks section).  Some figures (e.g., 1, 3, 4, ...) require higher resolution.  However, being a well explored problem, the review of the state of art and related works is limited.  The results are presented by images of the molecular structure. Performance metrics and a description in abstract formal notation of the algorithm used are appropriate."

While the work is of interest to the community, it requires further improvements. It is recommended to improve the following aspects: -To avoid possible bias in the evaluation it is recommended to use several evaluators not only one. -It is not clearly justified why the choice of the three systems assessed having more on the market. -There is no improvement in the style of writing, for example, inconsistencies in the use of references are observed, both numerical and name format are used (p. 7). Table 2 can be placed as an appendix, in the summaries no references are usually placed."
356,150,"The article presents a proposal for a model to evaluate the quality of software products for video conferencing based on open source. While this is a matter of interest and the proposal has elements of interest, the article presents some opportunities for improvement that should be addressed before their acceptance.  Content:-The ""Background"" section provides very little information to be a section as such. It is recommended to briefly explain the theoretical sustenance that the base investigations used.  -On several occasions it is mentioned that metrics were also defined, but at no point is there any reference to where they can be seen in details if the reader is interested. In addition, on page 5 it is indicated that they are 73 metrics, then on the page. 7 is said to be 72 and in the conclusions only 68 are highlighted.  -I suggest that the section ""Algorithm to apply the Quality Model ..."" is supported by some diagram to represent algorithms, for example, a flowchart or activities, since the text is somewhat confusing and does not allow to easily understand the proposed algorithm.  -It is not clear how the values of Table 4 were determined.  -It is not clear how the model was applied, how are the percentages of Table 5 calculated?  -Tables 2 and 3 are very extensive, which causes the reader to miss a bit of the analyzed context.

357,151,"The work carries out a review of the types of open data in Chile, although it is a job that must have taken a considerable time I do not see a direct contribution to the lines of research of the congress.  On the other hand, the future work indicated in the conclusion on developing a tool that allows to visualize the data of active transparency if it is interesting and will be of sure a contribution above all in the current contingency of the country."
358,151,"The Open Data of Chile This paper analyzes in a general way an issue that has acquired real relevance in the governments worldwide, the data open.  The problem addressed by the article is adequately supported by the needs that exist to provide data to assess transparency and public interest. An investigation is carried out to the main governmental web platforms in Chile. The objective is stated by the author and establishes that the state of the open data in Chile is presented and a diagnosis is made of the main sites and tools provided by the state to improve transparency and enhance citizen participation. The bibliographic review is relevant to the subject but rather general. The model that is used to measure the quality of data on the web is chosen without justifying through an analysis that establishes its efficiency compared to other models.  The revision of the concept of open data is minimal and is not present in the review carried out as this issue has been addressed in different countries and the results that they have obtained. The authors should further deepen the concept of open data at the government level for transparency and public interest and better support this division in the literature. The methodological aspect of the work focuses on using the 5-star model and describing a general classification that is done based on this model. Although this methodological approach is appropriate and is clearly associated with the subject, it does not present proposals to evaluate (research questions or hypotheses to be tested). The diagnosis is basic and general from a four variables that allow to classify each platform. The author should also establish a categorization of what the study subjects are (the government of Chile is mentioned but they are only four platforms of the total of platforms that the government has). In this sense it should refer to central service transversal platforms (since it does not analyze local governments at any time). This work is based on the use of a diagnostic model already validated in the literature. However, its application is limited and in my opinion it does not allow generalization for the entire government.  The contribution of the work is important as it presents relevant information in the process of reaching what is the open government. However the generalization of their results is questionable since it is limited to four variables and four websites. In the conclusions, the main contributions of the article are not clearly reflected and the authors are suggested to improve them by including aspects relevant to the subject matter evaluated (the websites), the contributions to the study of the open government in Chile, and to recognize the limitations of this study. The formal aspects of the work are satisfactory for the congress."

It also indicates within the disadvantages that it is not acceptable to work in real applications. But is it so that it is useful?"
360,152,"This work gives expected results and creates a structure for further research. I would suggest in addition of compass the use of radio waves for improving localization (WiFi for indoor and GPS for outdoor). In addition, there are some low cost platforms in the market that can be used and study, as for example Ardupilot or other similar systems. I was unable to see clearly enough, in the paper, the use of the camera; algorithms, environment settings, etc.; used for following robot. In Figure 7, it seems that camera trajectory is worse than that calculated with odometry, perhaps due to orientation error, but in my opinion it is not very clear during reading. Finally, I would suggest think if is it there some possible feedback of EKF results to odometry in order to reduce its error."

364,154,"The paper presents a study of the status of techniques and methods that the corpus of research offers for the treatment of requirements in agile environments. The theme is totally current and I agree with the authors that there is little done yet and it is a field of exploitation. There are, however, two comments I would like to pass on to the reviewers. The first is that it is not clear why they have not done a systematic review of the literature more formally. The justification they offer does not seem convincing to me. On the other hand, I would like to have further developed the future work. After a good job it is not clear to me that they have learned to put it into practice in their future research."
365,155,"In this work, an exploratory proposal is made on an adaptation profile of techniques for the construction of software requirements. The job is an extension of a previous job.

With regard to Table 2, it would be appropriate for the authors to put the rows of the table in the same order in which they list them. A couple of questions arise: How is the contextual situation of a project built? (padlock) Although I imagine it will be a similar process, how do you build the adequacy profile of the techniques? (key) Do you put the graph of the technique by dimension in a flat way? If they could clarify with any sentence.

This is inferred by the fact that the dataset is a graph of 31 vertices and 82 nodes.  -In the conclusions it is stated that it was detected that in Chile the level of knowledge regarding the problems generated by big data is meager. This is based on two references, but there is no work of its own to support this statement, as a national market survey could be."
368,156,"The article is properly written, except for some accents issues (will implement, use, ...) The tools used, as well as the implemented algorithms are properly described. The only criticism is the implementation of the same ones, carried out in a single machine (probably due to a problem of resources), something that takes away merit from the fact, considering that we are talking about techniques designed to be used in distributed form (where it should be its maximum use).  In spite of the above, I think it is a well-presented, valuable work in the discussion of the limitations of Hadoop vs Giraph, and whose results are interesting to know and debate in the field of the congress."

Further observations are included in the attached file."

The article shows the methodology well and has good wording. Metrics were added to measure the effectiveness of the algorithm.  This work was presented at INFONOR 2014 and the current wording is the same, which although it is true is good, presents the same small errors as in the previous article. Therefore, you must review it again.  Although it now shows metrics to measure the result, it is not indicated how effective this system is compared to the one used before.  You must improve the figures 12 and 15, where the metrics are displayed. Figure 2, left is not distinguished. A reference to Figure 11 is not included in the text."

However, in the same section there is no reference to Genetic Algorithms which is also part of this work.  In general, the work is interesting but it lacks a high innovative impact with respect to works associated with Genetic Algorithms.  In the Result and Evaluation section, a detail of Results Tables is displayed, however the discussion and explanation of results is only given in 1 paragraph. A clearer explanation for the meaning of each of the columns in the table and corresponding results would be expected.  In the references section there are 3 references [11], [12], [13] to set a definition, you would expect to have more references to similar jobs, perhaps you could include a section of Related Work.

Review text and correct grammatical errors, cut words at the end of a line, etc."
380,162,"The work is interesting, relevant. In particular the proposed control scheme. The following corrections are suggested: 1. The abstract (Spanish) and the abstract (English) present some minor differences. It is suggested to correct for both texts to express exactly the same. The same goes for keywords and keywords.  2. In Spanish, the scripts for separating words have spelling rules: the script must not separate the letters of the same syllable.  3. The equation (2) must be referenced in the text.  4. On page 3, second column: ""... is the control signal to designate, ..."". It is not ""to designate"" but to ""design"". Likewise: ""... feedback from states that ..."": It would be rather: ""... feedback from states such that ..."". 5. On page 4, first column: ""Engines will be used ..."", add tilde.  6. On page 4, figure 5: to correct the legend ""CONTROL SEUNDARIO"" to the corresponding block interior.  7. On page 4, second column: ""The sensors used in the gripper are resistive sen-sors, one of rotation to measure the artivulation of the arm"", resistive (coherence of number), articulation (typographical error). ""... from Texas Instrument to read ..."" It's Texas Instruments. Clarify the term ""calculating control"".  8. On page 5, second column: Figure 9 is referred to when it should be 8.  9. On page 6, first and second column: ""... is the output of the wrapper [?]."" Clarify the question mark. ""... in the diagram of the Figure."" What figure? In figures 10 and 11 it should be consistent with the term used: STA instead of ""AST"". 10. On page 7, first column: ""resultis"", ""compoara"", omission of the point at the end of the paragraph, ""the result"", ""In Figures 15, 15 and 16"". Add two or three paragraphs to discuss these three figures.  11. In the conclusions: interogante, was the implementation of the PD at the level of simulation or was the quadrotor really controlled? Clarify.  It is suggested to perform a complete revision of the text to make minor corrections: space after a comma, tildes, separation of words with dashes when it is passed from one line to another, separation between words, etc."
381,163,"The authors follow the methodologies SEMMA and CRISP-DM for the development of the project. Throughout the paper, the authors describe the phase of the methodology, the work done and the results obtained in this phase, except in the data mining phase (and clustering) that the authors postpone the description of the work and the results to section 5 of the paper. This makes the paper's structure not entirely clear.  Another thing, is the simplification of the variables to be taken into account when making the process of data mining, since it would have to take into account other aspects relating to the client, to the receiver, ..."
382,163,"The article deals with a data mining process aimed at describing groupings for the analysis of asset washes in the banking sector. It uses the CRISP-DM process as a methodological reference and follows it with some dedication.  As for the fund: it details too many aspects that relate to the descriptive part of the financial issue and the bank in particular where the development of the work is circumscribed. It also emphasizes obtaining the minable view that is fine, but neglects the generation of the data mining model, specifically not showing the clustering model, nor the levels of coverage and confidence in each regala of each cluster, does not perform a statistical analysis on the patterns and also does not observe a validation of the model and patterns obtained. The latter is the greatest weakness of the job.  In reference to the form: there are many errors of spelling and writing, excessive the length of some paragraphs and drafting of some topics that should be summarized, also written in fourth person and in some parts in future time, should standardize the wording to 3era person and time present, except in the conclusions that can occupy time spent. Exceeds the nro. of pages set as maximum. Finally, there is little bibliography (only 4) and not the references on either side.  It is an article that can be accepted but requires a deep reordering in terms of form, and fundamentally in relation to the data mining model, its analysis and thorough evaluation, as well as its results."
383,164,"In this work, a systematic review of the literature on the topic of software requirements management is carried out in small companies.  The work is relevant to the community given the limited information on this subject. As minor corrections it is recommended to work more the section of results adding the synthesis of the review as well as to discuss the results according to the research sticker raised, finally it is recommended to remove the reference that appears in the summary."
384,164,"As for the general aspects, three things: 1) the authors should be consistent with the nomenclature used: mainly requirements vs requirements: please use only one of the two denominations, but do not mix at your whim. 2) Second, small settings (small environments) vs small and medium enterprises. If they go to the definition given by the SEI, they will see that it is not the same, with the concept of small setting being wider. In this case I think the authors are referring to small businesses. 3) As a third comment, general, review the punctuation marks, very long sentences. In the summary, the authors indicate that they will offer a work proposal for small environments. I do not find that proposal for work on the article. Also, it is better not to put references in the summary. In the introduction, second paragraph, appears ""since it allows to guarantee DESDE ..."" is expected a EVEN SUCH THING ... In the systematic review process section, it is not necessary to do a subsection, it does not make much sense to split one thing into a single section. In the phase grant of the systematic review, they first say there are 3 steps and then call it phases. Which of the two is??? The names given to the phases do not match those of the following sections, nor do they match those of Figure 1. Figure 1 does not provide anything. In the planning section, words like ""over"" are not very valid in the written language. Equally in the planning they include paragraphs that justify the because of the SMEs, this is already out of context here. They also indicate that the objective of the review is to find models, methodologies, proposals or processes related to the management of requirements. Well, because this is what you expect to get in the results of the systematic review, and this, it does NOT appear just (only a list of methodologies appears and little more). They also mix improvement of software processes, with improved requirements management. They then indicate that the results are measured by number of proposals ... when they have previously said something else. The sections of the review do not faithfully follow those of Kitchenham, and Biolchini. Also in the ""search string"" part appears ""is that"", which in the written language does not remain well. The list of sources, why does it appear in the search string grant? In the review part, Table 3 and Figure 2 are redundant, if one more column is added to the table, indicating the corresponding percentage, we have the same effect. In the Review part, CANNOT DECIDE TO INCLUDE ONLY THE TOP 20, so that we do the systematic review? ??? Equally a single grant? ??. What are the 20 items you selected? Where are they referenced? It also goes with Figure 4 and Table 4. Regarding the results, it is assumed that the references 18 to 29 are the primary articles??? In these results they only indicate justifications regarding the management of requirements, but nothing relative to what they indicate in the objective of their systematic review. Based on a reference of the year 2007, the 24, indicate that no fairy that treats the management of requirements in small enterprises. He indicated only a doctoral thesis of the UfM of November 2013, titled Metamodelo for the improvement of the process of requirements management, whose author is Ariel E. Serrano Rico and Director José A. Calvo-Manzano, so that they see that there are things about requirements management. This is also the only place where they indicate a series of methodologies.  This is assumed to be one of the expected results, only appears in two lines of the results section. It then adds a number of key factors, and conditions that seem to appear on their own, without any reference and which are not the target that the authors say about the review they have done."
385,165,"The article is easily read, especially in its first half. Then there are writing and writing errors that affect the understanding of what was done (PostgrSQL instead of PostgresSQL, with has instead of contains, ...). In addition, steps are detailed, which fall into irrelevant details, such as to indicate what should be installed such or which tool, without entering into the really important aspects, especially in the implementation of the middle coupling (where, it is not detailed that it was implemented at the level of the SABD and that at the external level). The most critical thing is the use of two SABDs (PostgreSQL for weak coupling, and Oracle for medium and strong couplings) in experimentation, this makes it very questionable the comparison that, they no longer only have the implementation of the algorithm as an independent variable, but also the SABD to use.  In this way, I think that the work is worthy of being presented, in order to show, in particular, the different alternatives of integration of data mining algorithms with Systems of Data Databases."
386,165,"The article shows the empirical results of the integration (coupling) of the apriori algorithm into a SGBD.  They indicate that the work exhibited is based on the work of Agrawal & Shim, this work is of the year 1996, in this respect no more recent works? , Can you pick another more recent job? Why pick this job? Why this approach?  In the introduction there are missing references that allow us to base the work as a contribution a little closer to something scientific. For example "" There are some focused research "" ... which ones?  The work is writing rather as a technical experiment, than as a congress article.  The time and effort to carry out the tests are valued."

I think it would have been interesting to put it more rigorously. There are also some aspects, such as the fact that the list of selected new ones is not justified, where has that list been obtained? Is it closed?  I therefore advocate not accepting this work."
